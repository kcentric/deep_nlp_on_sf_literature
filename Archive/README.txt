I have kept a record here of old versions of main.py, the LDA and LDA testing files, and a couple
other files. This is so that anyone can see the process of development: the final, clean code
package did not come out of thin air, but after messy and complex phases of problem-solving.

Essentially, this archive is meant to contain code that I learned from, so that anyone reading can
benefit.
