" kirk eyed the mound of paper work on his desk and sighed
 nodded briskly toward the empty chair alongside his desk

" arthur kahler troy turned on his heel and strode toward the lieutenant until he was towering over him
 he turned away and walked slowly back to his desk chair and sat down
" he stood up and crossed to the desk and leaned down with his palms in the center of the brown blotter

 aware that his heart was pounding with excitement

 any such move would end his chances of getting his hands on naia north
 his job was to follow alma dakin to her rendezvous with this man orin and in some way force the two of them into turning naia north over to him

 she clung to him as he bent his head to meet her lips
 a little time of bewilderment when his guard slipped just a trifle
 he realized his right hand was aching and relaxed his grip on the gun butt he clutched
 he straightened up and the tense little mirthless grin played on his lips
 his grin deepened

 he was standing beside his barrel
 he watched the streets by night because her race and his were both non-sleepers
 san rorrek however had reduced his body-weight
 padded his cheekbones to give himself a gaunt appearance
 dyed his hair black and his skin a sallow shade
 he smeared his teeth with brown stain
 for in doing so he would broadcast his own thought-aura and reveal his presence to klia
 but evidently the idea of making him dig his own grave appealed to her icy sense of humor

 but the man had fingernails growing on his chin where his whiskers should have been
 then she pushed back his hair
 prodded at the purple knob on his head with careful fingertips

 hair grew thick all around his neck and clear up to his ears
 while gene held his throbbing head

 evidently cordell and miss dakin had gone out to direct the police when they showed up

 all because of a girl who had just finished confessing to two particularly unpleasant murders
 except one thing : cordell had been tried and convicted
 and tures was harsh and strains soft light from troy had been even more cult than he'd feared
 open anger and finally reluctant conviction that paul cordell was innocent of the crimes for which he had been sentenced to die
 it seemed naia north had disappeared from her locked cell during the night

 once more lieutenant martin kirk went back to  analyzing the broken phrases cordell had picked up while eavesdropping that october afternoon
 but he felt sure of what that had meant
 it was obvious chenowich had fallen off on the first curve
 but now that "taking" had come out "dakin" -- what did the rest of the phrase mean
 the north girl had confessed to murdering gilmore and juanita cordell
 taking her was martin kirk's job -- and it seemed he had a contact that would lead him to her

 since a leak after some noxious gas had been pumped into one of the bubbles could mean death for everyone aboard the gordak

 steve wondered if charlie had met the woman those final days on far ganymede
 but steve's wind had returned and now he sobbed air in great gulps
 was dimly aware that the other technicians had stopped their work to watch
 steve realized that the anger he felt for the woman had blinded him
 and charlie had the same idea
 this was the first time that steve had ever seen her without the black cape

 charging at leclarc before the frenchman had time to gather his wits
 he'd hardly had time to declare himself in the battle
 but then the third hunter had grasped her swirling black cape from behind
 kevin raised the neutron gun he had taken from leclatc
 especially since the anthrovacs had gotten hold of neutron guns and seerned to know how to use them
 i had an idea
 as if teejay's words had been a signal
 the three anthrovacs had ferreted them out with their neutron guns
 when half an hour had passed
 and i had barely enough air to make it
 but surely the frank buck had never been equipped for such flight
 kevin had some vague
 but while the gordak had only one animal -- the stone worm you got on mercury -- the frank buck had dozens
 does that mean leclarc had to be on the frank buck before anything happened
 with sentience and intelligence taking over where before only sentience had resided

 to miss dakin
 a discussion of any kind that may have become a bit heated
 i wouldn't insult my wife by saying such a thing to a third -- q: just answer the questions
 miss dakin is an intelligent girl
 she couldn't misunderstand or twist your words to that extent
 alma dakin's testimony was untrue
 series of calls designated to more information about akin university took him of secretaries bethe right person
 miss dakin at being able to get such a nice position

 why did miss dakin leave him

 so completely off that kirk didn't bother finishing what was much too involved to begin with

 dakin is watching -- that made sense
 as a confessed killer she must be taken into custody and booked on suspicion of homicide
 namely alma dakin
 green or otherwise
 i can't inline -- tt okay
 from an inner pocket kirk took out a small flat leather case and a thin-edged tool from that
 that would point to dakin as being more than a nine to-five secretary
 miss dakin
 kirk thought
 before kirk could find a cut-off switch of some kind
 even a man like martin kirk
 martin kirk
 it would r mean a padded cell -- and without even bothering to see if alma dakin possessed a machine more complicated than an electric iron
 asked a couple of questions that drew no answers
 over three hours from now
 but kirk was taking no chances
 a t #:# alma dakin again entered the bedroom
 a hunch
 or a sixth sense
 told kirk that this time something would pop
 and it was clear to him now how she was able to get at that hidden radio

 and with no trace of an alien accent

 the morning sun came in weakly at the window behind troy's huge polished mahogany desk
 troy began to wear another path in the moss-colored broadloom carpeting
" troy said in quieter tones
 the warden out there's probably got him in death row already
 "and so kirk cut in hotly
 in a last desperate effort to swing the tide of a losing battle

 he died of a heart attack about eight months ago
 he was connected with clement out in california
 he needed more evidence-evidence not to be explained away as coincidence
 and he could hear the faint rasp of her bell through the speaking tube
 for he knew absolutely no more about alma dakin than he fore entering her apartment personal papers
 he was ready to leave when it dawned on him that he had not yet looked under the bed
 almost his entire strength that he was able to shift the thing at all
 once he made sure nothing was anchoring the bed to the floor

 "he meant
 because die only other thing he could have meant was that he was going to alter the thing that makes it possible for any woman to handle any man

 i'm afraid that's just what he meant -- that he was going to change some factor in humanity that is responsible for this power we have over men

 let the air out of her or some we experiment he thing
 "he's been on the ship longer than any of us

 and he turned to find ann
 slid along the wall to the ddtsu it was all he could do to open it
 but once in the companionway outside he found that he could crawl along one wall
 "we've got to see if he can set us down faster
 "he detonated the pile

 but he added that he had been informed by leading physicists that the problem can be solved within a year if sufficient funds were available

 he climbed the stairs toward the second level
" "he never told me teejay was a woman

 he'd be talking like kevin soon
 and then he remembered charlie
 but steve was quicker and soon the distance between them increased and kevin realized he wouldn't be able to overtake steve at all

 he ached all over from the fight and he knew he'd need some mending
 with no solution in sight and grim confusion turned to grimmer anger as he faced tee jay once more

 then the irony of the situation struck steve and he smiled -- almost
 "what he needs is a good swift kick

 we have tried to make if different from any other science fiction magazine on the stands while still building it along the lines of what every science fiction mag must be
 the result has been unnumbered carloads of mediocre fiction
 also -- though we don't wish to underscore the point too heavily -- what could more surely have smothered the greatness of wuthering heights than a happy ending
 pwf  police grilled him mercilessly # while eyes from a hundred worlds looked on  it was a love-triangle murder that made today's headlines but the answer lay hundreds of thousands of light years away
 a rumpled shock of black hair pointed up the extreme pallor of a gaunt face
 involuntarily the young man's head turned aside to avoid came out of the wall of darkness and jerked it back again
 # a pair of hands thrust 'a second chair toward the circle of light
 kirk swung it around and dropped onto the seat
 our first idea was to stage the scoop of the century: get the lead novel from howbe given an infant publication than browne's name on the cover
 it has the largest circulation in its field and up to january # th (the day if went on the science fiction magazine your money could buy
 under the name of john evans
  seemed not so much indications of defiance as they did the result of some terrible and deepseated shock
 without haste the lieutenant fished a cigar from the breast pocket of his coat and began almost leisurely to strip away its cellophane wrapper
 a kitchen match burst into flame under the flick of a thumb nail and a cloud of blue tobacco smoke writhed into the cone of hot light
 kirk waved away the layer of smoke hanging between them
" "take it from five o'clock the afternoon it happened
 is the ames chemical company
 it must've been about quarter to six when i got out to the university
" kirk nodded to one of the men behind him and a package of cigarettes was extended to the man under the light
 "let's hear the rest of it
 i said something or other to alma -- she's the profs secretary -- and went on through the door to the hall that leads to the private lab
" ' the young man's jaw hardened
 then two quick flashes of light lit up the frosted glass door panel
 standing a good two feet off the floor in the middle of a big blue ball of some kind of -- of soft fire
 something hit me on the side of the head and i
" the prisoner stared at him woodenly
 the frown deepened but the young man answered promptly enough
 at approximately # : # on the afternoon of october #
 cordell to go directly to the laboratory at any time without being announced
 " 'at the time stated above
 cordell came running back into the office and told me to call the police
 cordell was the only person to enter the laboratory between #:# that afternoon and # : # when mr
 to the best of my knowledge
 yet a qualified physician states both deaths were caused by a terrific blow from a blunt instrument we found a lot of tilings around the lab you could have used to do the job -- -but nothing at all of anything like a projectile fired from a gum" the prisoner obviously wasn't listening
 "all i said to alma dakin was a couple of words -- three or four at the most -- about not working too hard
 kirk ignored the demand
 by #:# that afternoon the ceiling lights were on
 stopped at martin kirk's cubbyhole and slid an evening paper across the battered brown linoleum top of the lieutenant's desk
 ignoring the "girl from mars" angle
  kirk shoved the' paper aside
 dozen picked up the receiver
" a moment later the patrolman loomed up outside the cubbyhole door
 she placed on a corner of kirk's desk an alligator bag that matched her shoes and tucked ple yellow gloves the color of her blouse under the bag's strap
 the lean lines of a solid jaw
 the dark hair that was beginning to thin out above the temples after thirty-five years
" "aren't you the officer who arrested the young man who today was sentenced to die
 the one the newspapers call 'the girl from mars
 any murder hitting the headlines brought at least one psycho out of the woodwork
 but naia north showed none of the signs of the twisted mind
 while the last two items could have been true of a raving maniac
 the day the trial ended
 #  kirk picked up his cigar from the edge of the desk and tapped the ash onto the floor
" naia north failed to respond to the light touch
" she put both elbows on the desk and bent toward him
 you know the evidence given at the trial -- particularly that given by gilmore's secretary 
 he said something particularly nasty to me and i grabbed up a short length of shiny metal from the workbench and hit him across the side of the head before lie knew what was happening
 he staggered out of the room and down the hall and i could hear a lot of excited talk and greg's secretary calling the police
 so i came out of the closet and looked down the hall
 "there's almost certain to be some of your prints on the inside of that closet door -- maybe even on that length of metal
 scooped up the telephone and gave a series of rapid-fire orders
 then dropped the instrument on its cradle and turned back to where she sat watching him curiously
" kirk flushed to the eyebrows
 why the confession
 two men from the crime lab are already on their way to the university
 k --   ja  ' w ia v -va vr va' #e mar standing a good two feet off the floor in the middle of a glowing bubble that pulsed arid wavered around her 
  -- at the other a micro tic trace of human blood
 she thanked him with a wan smile and d down the contents
 getting in every possible angle of her private life as well as minute details of her actions on the day of the kirk had not been present durin that part of the night
 it was arthur kahler troy at the other end and the ix a
 lieutenant -- five men and five locked doors stood between that girl and the street
 picking up random reflections from the collection of expensive gadgets littering the glass top
 martin kirk pushed himself deeper into the depths of a brown leather chair and watched the d
 and i'm going to find out the answers to all three if i have to turn this town on its ear
 the first thing: what about paul cordell
 "the morning paper
 the girl might have confessed the whole thing was a hoax and we tossed her out of here last night
 good morning -- good luck -- and kindly close the door on your way out"    chapter iv l ieutenant the pile of mimeograp pages aside
 three hours through the complete script of the corde
 thing to do was go down to the comer tavern and have a couple of fast ones and watch an old movie on television
 once more martin kirk went over the few lines
 or was it because she wanted to shield the real killer
 of very decorne to the sity m only a day lins
 co-discoverers of the (according to miss slife) been engaged to take place
 and suffere stroke of some kind while at  kirk thanked her broke the connection
 deaths of these four scientis the result of some sinister who was responsible
 and the word meant men and women in the same line of work as the professor -- nuclear physics
 but the last of the quotations wnt nowhere at all
 "washing" could have been the first two syllables of washington -- and washington would be the place where the atomic energy commission hung out
 s ight of the ambling figure of patrolman chenowich passing the office door caught his eye
 the last of the killer's cryptic remarks was now clear
 but alma dakin hadn't been watching anything at the time of dell
 that would leave dakin was watching as the right combination
 the nice smooth story of quited love was probably as much a lie as the personal information naia north had given arthur kahler troy
 he entered the building foyer and looked at the name plates above the twin rows of buttons
 the foyer was very quiet at this time of day
 the lieutenant mounted the stairs to the third floor
 was to enter the tlie door 
 the bedroom seemed even less promising at first
 was almost indecently fond of frothy undergarments and black transparent nightgowns -- interesting but not at all important to the over-all problem
 no savings ing-account scrawled line of mas greetings the apartment's to kirk's lack of such highly significant her bavin his already strong suspicion of her was solidified into certainty of her guilt
 he pushed up the hanging edge of the green batik spread and peered into the narrow space
 to reach a section of the floor near the footboard
  the bed failed to move
 kirk pressed down harder on the knob
 a tiny click sounded against the silence and a section of wopd some three feet square swung out
 the detective found himself staring at an instrument board of some kind with a series of buttons and dials countersunk into it
 the board itself formed a part of what was obviously a machine of some sort which evidently contained its own power
 on the other hand it could be some sort of infernal machine
 ready to blow half the city to bits at the turn of a dial
 like a direct radio newscast from half around the world
 then ceased -- and without warning daylight from the window washed over the bewildered and thoroughly frightened police officer
 and the seeming miracle naia north's escape from a cell block now passed from fantasy to the factual
 at this moment undoubtedly the most bewildered man alive
 by the time the red tape was unsnarled the former secretary could have reached pakistan on foot
 the superintendent admitted kirk to the dakin apartment and went down to the
 foyer to ring the bell in case the girl arrived at the wrong time
 he soothed the lieutenant's anxiety somewhat by explaining that she seldom returned the place before seven o'clock
 even the rustle of a nylon slip as she drew it over her head
 but nothing she did was worthy of notice in the home-town paper or even on the margin of a police blotter
 placed a sheet of blank paper on the cover of a historical romance lifted from the spinster's nightstand
 a motor whined unexpectedly from the opposite side of the apartment wall and he could hear a heavy object roll with well-oiled smoothness a short distance across the carpet
 look at the chance we took by permitting them to hold her even briefly
" the dim humming came back again
 alma dakin was preparing to take it on the lam
 place alma dakin under arrest and force the whole story from her
 caused him to abandon the idea
 he was opening the door of his car by the time the girl came out of the front entrance
 near the crest of a particularly steep hill
 then he swung his wheel to the right and coasted to a halt on the soft shoulder of the road
 naked of foliage at this time of the year
 kirk worked his way silently ahead until' he could make out the dim figure of the girl as she dragged the pair of bags from the boot
 she turned away from the road and an instant later was lost to sight among the trees
 but fortunately the same was true of alma dakin
 at last the seemingly interminable forest ended and the girl sank wearily down on an upended suitcase
 beyond where the girl sat was a large natural clearing covered with a fringe of winter grass
 only the faint keening of a chill wind and the restless creak of barren branches kept it from becoming unbearable
 gradually his eyes became more and more accustomed to the absence of light worthy of the name
 alma dakin had uttered a cry of relief and was racing toward the nearest edge of the gleaming vessel
 they came together almost violently midway between the clearing's edge and the ship
 kirk glanced past them at the open portal
 dim light from within cast a soft glow against the night
 bridged the gap to a killer
 and so potent was the mood of the whole setup
 but the stairway hid him and the pair passed by and went on down the corridor
 the wall of the ship opened to form a doorway
  the grin 'was tighter than ever
 orin and alma left the ship
 with the sun at high noon
 but after a while when your mind seems halfway over the edge
 and the tropical forest with the great big fart sun overhead
" kirk eyed the girl
 i was referring to those of the five galaxies
 kirk lowered the gun
 kirk then experienced a strange feeling of unreality which persisted until the girl returned
" "the distance is around two hundred thousand light years but the ship doesn't really travel at all
" kirk replied and silently added: keep to the line

 'the same way y  frown mean you were "not away on that n't  the beautiful brow immediately cleared
 "i am now free of the assignment
 when she started to turn away from the mirror 
 kirk glanced at the silent raima standing with her hand on the tiger's head
 the little mirror turned opaque
 dropped gently into the street beside kirk
" "it came to the mirror on naiads private wave-length
" kirk crawled into the car
 that's the way i always cross the air
 spidery buttresses and the first blow came but that was moved across the city
 kirk filled not true with the second
 kirk radiance and the kick of a missouri stepped out
 k irk came to with the feelclever little devil
" but naia pressed the point
 a man of fine and commanding appearance stood within the globe
 suspended about a foot from the floor
 the globe and the man gave every indication of having just come through the opaque glass wall of the room
 the overlord of the galaxy
" the lieutenant eyed the door frame warily
" the police officer stepped cautiously through the opening and on into a luxuriously furnished room
 tamu gestured and naia north turned to leave the room
" the girl glanced at the overlord and shrugged helplessly
 tamu and the man from earth sat down across from each other on a pair of fragilelegged chairs
 the overlord leaned back and sighed
 and police officers are trained to do the job right
 overlord paused to drink from and to cast a speculative the stolid face of martin kirk might as well have studied the contours of a brick wall

 she was sent to take the lives of gregory gilmore and juanita cordell
 "alma dakin tried to cover up the truth by making it appear both scientists had died at the hands of a jealous husband
 both because of her perjured testimony and the fact that paul cordell insisted on telling the truth
 naia was sent back to confess the crime
 the eyes of both tamu and naia north were glued
 to the grim visage of homicide lieutenant kirk

 steve got a hand up in front of his body
 he jabbed with his left hand
 wiping his bloody lips with a handkerchief
" kevin jabbed a thick finger against his calloused palm
 although he knew she'd probably have a hard time matching his twenty-five years
 returned with three heavy asbestos suits draped ponderously over his arm
 strapping a neutron gun to the belt of his asbestos suit
 clumsy helmet over his head
 steve could feel the crunchy ground powdering beneath his asbestos boots with every step
 it was then that his left leg began to bum
 something hissed in his ears and he knew teejay had turned the outside dial of his air-pump all the way over
 but the pain still cut into his leg
 his left leg wrapped in bandages from knee to ankle
" kevin shrugged his massive shoulders
 frenchie had better watch his step
 steve was eating his first solid meal in two days
 steve hobbled with his crutches to the general lounge
" steve shook his head
 did the fear crawl around the edges of his brain because he thought teejay was responsible
 schuyler barling and three of his officers entered the gordak
 barling got out of his vacsuit first
 his neutron gun clattering away
 teejay whirled on his officers
 he rubbed his jaw
 steve flipped it over on the back of his left hand
 barling shook his head stubbornly
 and kevin was there to nod his red head
 and steve could picture him frowning inside his helmet
 my god -- and clumsily in his vacsuit
 he climbed the ringwall laboriously and then made his way down
 but the voipe whispered in his ears
 that he realized his supply of air would be exhausted in three hours
 peered with horror at the glassite inches from his face until he saw that it hadn't cracked
" steve called into his intercom
 drawing a neutron gun from his belt
 leclarc stood there with his neutron gun
 a grealy salve covering the discoloration on his jaw
 hooking his left fist at the bigger man's jaw
 something exploded against steve's jaw and he did a quick flip and landed on his back
 but steve chopped at his face with short
 saw kevin and leclarc off to his right
 steve began to pull himself upright and got a knee in his face
 he hadn't lived a violent life like kevin or teejay -- such things were not part of his background
 right now kevin held his own with the two hunters who'd done steve in
 steve smiled grimly as he clambered to his feet to help kevin
 steve pounded once and then again with his left hand at the man's midsection
 then finished by crossing his right and feeling it crunch against the man's jaw
 steve toted teejay over his shoulder
" barling scratched his head
 and steve gritted his teeth when the second turned out to be worse than the first
 shaking his head slowly back and forth
" steve felt his heart pounding
" the woman met his gaze levelly
 steve looked at his brother
 standing two paces to her right and apparently listening to an account of his own demise
 once steve looked back over his shoulder and saw the purple mists had almost completely swallowed the frank buck
 ran a hand through his red hair
 and steve pulled up short at the sound of his voice
 one small part of his mind expecting a roundhouse right-handed wallop from the old teejay
" someone -- steve saw it was steiner -- stood before them clearing his throat
 he got to his feet with a nasty gash on his  forehead which teejay bandaged with a strip of cloth ripped from the hem of her black cape
 steve heard it inside his head and this time -- because they all stood about more bewildered than ever -- he knew that the frank buck's crew heard it too
 kevin had to circle steve's body with his huge arms and hold him firm as they took teejay away
 his potential worst enemy had become his lover
" steve shouted his rage
 he could open his eyes and stare at the green 'liquid
 sharp pain lanced from the front of his skull to the back
 clung to his brain
 within his skull
 iey fear making his heart pound
" said the voice in his skull
 something grabbed his arms and held ita giant vise which could crush and twist
 steve toyed with his freedom
 his mind found the strange telepathic channel of the parasite
" a clarion command inside his skull
 an inch at a time toward his chest
 perhaps it could not fight his hatred
" kevin shook his head grimly
 with each man living in his own particular continuum
 he'd managed to fight his way back with them
 took up his position near charlie
 his shoulder jarred charlie's knees
 froth flecking his chin
" steve clamped the fishbowl helmet down over his head and activated the airlock
 his magnetic boots gripped the frank bucks steeloid hull as he set himself
 the big exec reached out to grab him but his arm fell a full foot short
" kevin cleared his throat ominously
 he tightened his grip on the big blasters
 blacky was perched solidly atop his head
 raised his hands
 the mayor put his arms about the two men
" the mayor nodded his head
" he shook his head and chuckled again
 he tapped his finger on the back of his other hand and stared at the two earthmen
 he reached over toward the inteicom on his desk then and pressed a button
" gal opened his mouth
 his most discernible characteristic is beyond doubt a never-yielding determination
 they jammed up editor palmer's typewriter and stole pertinent copy off his desk
 ziff is a civic-minded individual who gave and still gives a great deal of his time to projects outside his firm
 its failure was due to circumstances beyond his control
 he hung from the post by his ' wrists
 the wan sunlight glistened faintly on his naked back as he waited
 lips moving slowly as he pressed his face against the rough wood and stood on tiptoe to relieve the growing ache in his shoulders
 he hung by the nails that pierced his forearms just above the wrists
 perhaps in his tenth marsyear
 and tried to wipe his chin on the post
 after three hours of dangling from the spikes that pierced his arms
 but the heartbeats labored in his head like a hammer beating at red-hot iron
 a rhyme from his childhood
 and his vision blurred
 slubil occasionally laid the knife against his skin and took it away again
 then asir heard the rustle of the executioner's cloak as his arm went back
 asir opened his eyes
 the stroke fell -- and the blade chopped into the post above his head
 the executioner rolled him over with his foot
 asir groped at his forehead
 asir climbed weakly to his feet
 his face was stiff as weathered stone
 asir bowed his head
 shaking his head
 the vaults -- " he stammered and shook his head
 but she hung onto his arm and pleaded with him
 i sat on his lap and kissed his bald pate for you
" he dropped his hands and grunt- ed a low curse
 she leaned back against him easily and rested her dark head on his moulder
 he kissed her--"while his hand felt gingerly for the knife at her belt
 his fingers were numb but he managed to clutch dt
 the point was a foot rom the small of his back
 he shook his head and resumed the descent toward the vaults
 big joe slept his restless sleep
 he shielded the candle with his hand and peered downward toward a small square of dim light
 big joe remained in his motionless crouch
 but big joe settled back in his crouch
 and this time the monster started out of his drowse again
 keeping his eyes on big joe
 he moved up to the fifth square upon which the monster growled his first warning
 big joe will kilir he opened his eyes again and heaved a breath of relief
 wondering if it would result in his sudden death
 continuing his bluff
 kill them he turned his back on the throng in the hall and continued the cautious advance
 his heart sank
 the executioner nodded grimly and took a short-axe from his belt thong
 his left foot striking the zero-tile
 welkir was on his kneqs
 his secondary function is to direct the technologists to records containing such information as they may need
 his tertiary function is to carry out simple directions given by the technologists if such directions are possible to his limited design
 despite the fresh redness about his hands and jaws
 but could not admit ignorance to mara who clung tightly to his arm
 corrigan sighed loudly and pushed back his sandy hair
" wingfield turned his head from side to side
" corrigan leaned up against a boulder and looked straight at his companion
 his eyes wide with sick horror
 lying on his back eyes wide open as he stared unblinkingly into the heart of the yellow sun
 he put his ear close to morse's mouth and listened
 a fine powdery cloud of yellow dust rose about his body
 he turned to wingfield who wis nodding his head vacantly
 corrigan had his own ideas
" wingfield clutched his arm
 corrigan wondered absently what image the beast would pick from his mind
 wingfield strapped the pack onto his back
" corrigan shook his head doggedly
 there was a basic bitterness in his eyes wingfield had noticed be- fore
 wingfield said something under his breath
 the sun became unbearably hot and corrigan felt as though his brain was frying slowly
 his eyes hurt and the yellow landscape became shot through with deep flashes of crimson
 the other was slung across his back
 wingfield dropped his canteen
 his mouth close to the pool's edge
 corrigan jammed the rifle butt against his hip but he was powerless to slap the trigger bar
 no more good than it would have done wingfield who was on his knees crooning to his loved ones
 he raised his gun and sent five flaming slugs from its muzzle to smash the slavering maw until the great beast-skull was a red stub spouting blood

 and his crisp black hair was close-cropped in the fashion of the bachelor who had not et sired a pup
 and he had visions of them chuckling together in tokra's villa over a glass of amber wine
 his father had been a renegade before him
 had squandered his last ritual formula to buy a wife
 asir had stolen more than wealth
 he had stolen the strength of their souls
 suppose she had wheedled the sentence out of tokra
 slubil had marked him as an outcast
 slubil had bound the spike-wounds
 darkness had fallen by the time he came to welkir's house
 he had dragged her a dozen doorways from the house of her father
 t he great creature made no protest as they climbed up the broad flat back and strapped themselves down with the belts that had been threaded through holes cut in the hiiften's thin
 somehow they had to get past big joe before the guards came thundering after them
 and he had memorized them with a stolen bit of ritual
 big joe had returned to his former position
 he had tested only one two -- back near the door
 their pursuers were gaining rapidly and they had crossed only half the distance to the opposing doorway
 asir saw that the robot's head had turned so that he was looking directly back at the thief and the girl
 asir also saw that someone had approached the door again
 they had gone about five hundred yards when corrigan stopped
 remembering the way morse had laughed with them the night before
" he knew full well what wingfield had gone through
 she wore the dress she had been wearing on the last day he
 they can make and have made many an editor cry 'uncle" and wish he had never gotten off the straight and narrow path of science fiction
 for a week buckmaster had ignored the fact that everything he ate tasted like flavorless gruel
 there was no doubt now but that he had the dread plague
 at first he sus pected the outlgt of his emotions had somehow become atrophied as had his senses
 some subtle compulsion within him -- some power struggling in its birththroes -- was beginning to breed its own energy and he send that it was the strength of that compulsion that had subdued the terror
 some time later he grew aware that his sense of hearing had returned
 they had screwed up the back until he sat almost straight
 the great atomic war had ended
 the colossus of the western hemisphere had set up autonomous launching stations so that if and when their major cities had all been bombed their ruling bodies decimated and scatteredeven if there were no longer any vestiges of a central authority -- the launchings would continue
 the autonomous units had been a stroke of master plannings so ingenious that it was logical the giant of eurasia had devised a similar plan b y the time the bombs had all been used
 koski had landed with a force of seventy thousand on the east coast of old mexico
 by the end of twenty years the city had grown to near one hundred fifty thousand
 he saw that wagner had no intention of ever letting him live
 he had read wagner's mind because wagner had not realized he could do it
 originally wagner had been an unlettered lad from the steppes
 soon koski had made him his personal adjutant
 that the city's functions had come under the control
 from the time he had taken over superior
 until he had control of the entire continent -- in the name of the mother country
 his great bony features had lost all powder of expression except their habitual scowl
" wagner had to admire the will to destruction that still rode the old man
 it was the one secret that wagner had not been able to learn
 "at least the urge to kill koski is so strong within me that i know i would not hesitate if i had the chance
 though he had not had the practice at this that wagner had
 they had the mark of killers about them
 he had shot at a reflection of wagner
 it had been a cleverly arranged mirror deception
 had given koski his instructions long before
" many times since koski had gone over that conversation in his mind
 buckmaster realized that wagner had been keeping this until he 
 wagner had a private elevator
 when they had travelled about a half block it stopped
 so vital had been the command
 he had nothing to occupy his time
 objective thing we had always taken it to be mat ter began to thin away into the completely spectral thing it has now become
 he still had no control of events -- like a dream that cannot be halted or changed
 through a doorway and out into a courtyard before he realized what had happened
 the force had turned time backward
 he was exactly the same as he had been the last time but with the addition of his memories of having been shot
 but the ttuth he had discovered was
 had an ultimate being whom i j worshipped
 it had seemed only a night of deep and dreamless sleep
 each open locker meant a man had gone and lived his time with the new generations of the ship
 yesterday -- he laughed mirthlessly when he realized that had been almost two hundred years ago -- clair had told him something about a note
 clair -- if clair had married
 a man who had seen earth
 lazarus six had a very short reign
 because he had just concluded a hundred-seventy five year nap
 where the six before him had lived
 just an unreal past and an unreal earth which eric and their great-great grandparents had seen
 they watched the old films of earth and felt they had been cheated out of their birthright
 e ric recognized at once the great hall in which he had danced that last night with clair
 what laurie said had troubled him -- he had had a bad night's sleep
 the men whose vision had sent man -- here in this ship -- outward bound to the stars
 had somehow maintained the science of another generation
 had sent the people down a rung or two on the ladder of civilization
 and as the girl laurie had said
 there had been a first generation which had known earth and could savor its flavor through the long years like a delicate wine
 of the proud day when all the world had seen them off
 had a vision
 it was the same vision which had first taken man -- an ape with a brain that held curious half formed thoughts that gave him a headache -- down from the trees
 he had plenty of time
 their first rush carried them almost to the control room and briefly eric remembered when he had looked out from there with clair at the bright faraway stars
" he had seen laurie in the vanguard of the newcomers
 not as they had been meant to be used
 now eric had larkin down
 then the laughter faded as larkin stared stupidly at the gun he had not known how to use
 eric had seen other eyes like that
 this had to be pat nichols
 after seventytwo hours in which greg had had to do without anesthesia
 it seemed incredible that a man who had advanced to stage five in the dream continuity scale
 and who had been in anesthesia most of the time
 but pat nichols had always been a part of his conditioned personality pattern
" a spot of nausea bounced into greg's stomach at drakeson's reference to what the big chain blowup had done to almost all high cellular life forms
 thought about it at all until pat had started talking peculiarly
 so i had to steal a couple of heat-blasters  from the museum
 a man who had reached stage five had been an anesthesiac too long to find reality comfortable
 the cruiser had to move through a series of locks to the outside
 except that some humans within it had a habit of changing
 one chain had been enough
 the earth had been thoroughly wrecked
 venusian colonization had been organized three years before
 at least four known spaceships had been constructed
 it had just never occurred to greg that pat could go psycho and join them
 according to what little he had gotten from infotapes
 a broad mushroom-like growth had opened a mouth
 greg had the heat-blaster up
 so he decided that colonists had probably saved drakeson
 cyr why he had been left here
 had saved drakeson from that plant thing
 he had gotten himself into a completely un-codified situation
 one of the first who had escaped from the cowl
 he saw the self-inverting three dimensional mechanism that had given him that starkly real adventure in which he had been able to kill

" a low gasp from alaia who had been watching die screen

" sahl wondered how much information had been gleaned from him along with his language
 another suspicion entered his mind: that this ship had been designed specifically for this one mission
 the skipper apparently had reacted more angrily
 who apparently had been more eager than the rest to take advantage of the eridanian's "generous offer"

 faron had returned to the power room
 the jolting had stopped
 the sun had set

" macker had no criticism to offer to this suggestion
 but -- " uncle peter's mind had gone off on another track
 he had a heart of gold and meant well
 he had hardly expected the display of completely impersonal bravery that uncle peter put on
 the roadster had made a turn on two wheels and was going west
 "i wish we had all the parts to this puzzle
" it made my blood run cold to hear this girl refer so casually to the wholesale slaughter that had been going on around us
" the blonde had an answer
 uncle peter had just finished spiking the barkeep's drink with a clear fluid from a small vial
 evidently we had interrupted uncle peter and hands in the process of doing away with all the latter's enemies
 and i had no trouble in overtaking the little assassin
 it seemed that the police had orders to pick him up because two uniformed patrolmen had him backed against the wall and were approaching him with caution
 yes -- with one change
 and one of barling's officers came over to verify it
 a big figure # ind a little one
 one which had been reared with one of the circus troupes
 and it burst completely when steve remembered he was the only one who could hear the voice
 there's only one alternative
 when one of barling's men had jumped him
 as one
 and the struggle had attracted no one
" the nine-foot anthrovacs took up their positions one on each side of the column and one behind it
 and no one disobeyed
 and that wrenching from one spatial plane to another might explain the tremendous pain they'd undergone
 this one didn't
 "one hundred thousand
" the academic problem didn't bother teejay as much as the human one
 men circulated between one group and another
 and finally one of them
 and one of them is this : he has complete confidence in his captain
 and that's one thing i had to learn
 it's one thing to serve on a largely automatic ship under captain barling
 one is kevin mccann
 it was one thing to offer their allegiance to the captain of another ship -- and an unusual thing at that -- but quite another to offer it to a couple of men they hardly knew
 "i have one order
 one of the men darted for the doorway
 one tiny
 so ludicrous to human eyes -- they probably appeared that way to one another as well
 one hundred choice specimens
 although only one female of the species is present
 one after another: "three char
 one hundred is not enough
 and one by one the men were sold
 once one of them
 he was cut down quite efficiently by one of the handweapons and charlie stedman asserted it was a pity one of the specimens had been lost
 one specific high degree of emotion is possible only when a male and a female are in one another's presence
 whichever one of you owns the female can be certain of that added stimulus
 "one of us must die
 a fatal one
 and one of them fell as a beam of energy seared out and caught him
 but steve grabbed one of the stilt-creatures
 with one blow
 one life more wouldn't matter
 and there isn't one down on the gordak
 one of these neutron guns can be a potent weapon
 continued on page # only one question seemed important in this huge space venture: who was flying where
 a big mirror over one of the dressers
 one man looked exactly like calvin manners
 and a suspicious one
 no one could disagree with this last except to suggest that rap far understates the extent of shaver's vocabulary
 and a nightly banquet upon which he squandered twenty-one cents
 such a bomb as this one
 shaver and had but one comment : "kill it
 it must be assumed that no one really dies
 are exactly twenty to one
 there are very few men aged one hundred and ten with the strength to come forward
 one eye closed in a solemn wink
 he was still in one piece
 no one ever tried to enter
 the gixards expected no one
 he imagined vaguely that one must call them out in a loud voice before the inner entrance
 the second with one
 one meant a square to the southeast
 see the gray one at the left of the door
 "this one
 "diagonally left -- one ahead -- diagonally right
 with the girl following one square behind him
 looking back to count squares and make certain that the next step was not a fatal one
 but one
 being interested only in the machinery"can't you allow them one small mistake
 corrigan went in one direction
 he could #ee wingfield's head above one of the boulders
 one hand scooped up the rifle even as he was turning

 "you are one of the underground that is trying to overthrow the general

 there was no one to whom they could surrender
 i those armies with weak commanders fell apart and one by one their men died at the hands of hostile natives
 at least one of which must be a ruskie
 whatever else might be mystifying to him he knew one thing: the instinct of self-preservation was still as strong as ever
 concentrate on the right one
 one part of his brain accepted it passively
 one last warning
 then stopped breathing as a tall man -- one of the ruskies -- leaned over beside him and said
 "he -- " "yx)u're forgetting one thing
 "we'll get two birds with one stone
 the one thing wagner could not tolerate was ridicule
 to tip that scale one way or the other
 one eye was closed and blood
 one joint at a time
 there is but one entity
 all reality is one in substance
 one in cause
 one in origin
 mind and matter are one
 and the force which draws the planets are one
 were figments of one giant imagination
 and one man only
 that man was the one fnan who uhought
 that man is the one who uhinks

 he glanced up at big joe
 he looked up at big joe and spoke in a loud voice
 two --  he paused to stare into the room beyond
 he stared
 he turned and whispered to the chief commoner
 he peered at big joe and saw that the monster remained motionless
 when he passed the place of the first warning voice
 then he spoke to big joe
 he waited a long time
 jakes  t he forward cabin of the little ship was unbearably hot
 he gazed up at the yellow ball of the sun and said
" he started up the hill
 a minute later he got up and faced wingfield
 he said mg and black dfhimdl and i saw my wife "the heat
 he screamed in a final burst of strength
 he tried to think clearly wingfield stood by
" he heard wingfield giggle
 behind him he heard the beast snarl
 he knelt down and sniffed
 he got up and said to wingfield
 he turned to wingfield
 corrigan thought of the beast and wondered how he would feel when they caught up with it
 he won dered -- about both himself and wingfield
 but wingfield was making motions in the air as if he were struggling with an invisible human being
 her hair the exact corn color that he remembered
 he stared straight ahead through bleak eyes
 devet t he sense of taste was always first to go
 in the hospital he found himself herded with several hundred others into a ward designed to hold less than a hundred
 w th the realization came the certainty that he would not die
 "he was in the last stages about an hour ago
 he'd heard of wagner before
 he nodded
 by the time he reached the southern border of minnesota he realized from what he saw on all sides
 when koski reached duluth he circled the city
 koski knew he could capture the city if he decided to
 could he be hurt by someone like wagner
 he decided to wait until later to put it to the test
 he did not want to take the chance that the extraneous will he felt within him would be strong enough to combat what wagner would try to do to him
 subtly he felt the first tentative probe of wagner's thought antenna
 he doubted that he could make it but at least he should try to get to duluth
 he breathed easier as he rested against the iron railing waiting for the gate to open 
 he fumed inwardly as he mounted the stairs to the general's second floor receiving room
 wagner held the most powerful position in the city -- that of security administratoti by now koski was so far gone that he did not even realize he did not rule
 he sat on a steel-framed bed
 "i know he believes what he is saying
 he was head of the underground solely because he was the fittest man for the job
 if he kills me first
 ter improvised a simulated course of action to let seep through to wagner whenever he felt a probe
 he caught nothing from wagner in return that was not deliberately let through
 toward evening he improvised a crisis
 he wanted buckmaster to stay on and give first hand reports
 if he were able to squeeze through just a short ten seconds the job could still be done
 he pulled out the small single-shot derringer con cealed there
' wagner said as he stood in front of them
 or would he lose the last cha
 he wondered where he found the strength to keep taunting wagner
 he meant to torture him to the verge of death
 but he did not intend to let him die without further torment
 he strapped buckmaster's wrists to a waist-high wooden rack
 he lifted buckmaster's right index finger and cut deeply through the flesh' of its tip
 he sucked in great gulps of air until at last he could stand no more pain and welcome oblivion blanked him out
 he prayed that wagner would tire of his pleasure before he had to stand any more
 and he sent a bolt of mental energy at wagner's head
xertion and he was free
 he was too smart -- as well as legally exact -- to disown me
 that he knew what he had said was true: koski must die
 at last he knew
 posite vision vanished and he saw the handsome features of gamoll again
 he knew that he was going to die
 as he opened the door and stepped into a long green-carpeted room he found himself facing three guards
 he knew the bullets had reached vital organs and that he was about to die
 this time when he came to the fatal door there was no surge of rebellion and he did not hesitate
 he walked around the house until he came to the basement entrance
 but he knew with a terrible certainty that he would not be able to kill the other in time to save himself
 buckmaster fired again but even as he did he felt a second bullet enter his body
 he wrote: we are the flitting forms of a being greater than ourselves and endless while we die
 but they reckoned without t he seventh tub shook gently
 three minutes after he started the mechanism
 through a doorway he could see the children
 hit him soon after he came to us
 he did not relish the idea particularly
 he padded across the bare floor and opened the door
 he was a scapegoat
 he watched silently with lindquist and captain larkin as the two other men took laurie
 in time he could find out
 "he's seen earth
 he did not see the girl anywhere in the great hall
 he blew two loud notes this time
 but he felt a little sick as larkin ran
 as he went to the three remaining tubs

 greg didn't know hpw he'd managed to remain sane
 he'd chart her location with the rhodium tracker niy: thi beams
 unless he got out there and stopped her before that suicide ship rocketed out from its hidden subterranean blast tube
 greg felt the physical power flow as he ran
 was strained as he moved the cruiser into the first lock chamber
 he'd never seen the sun before
 he sent the cruiser climbing rapidly above the weird grotesque terrain
 t he audio in the control panel cracked out
 he felt drakeson move
" greg hardly felt the injection as he tried tb think
 he would submit to brain-probing
 but he'd get pat out of that trap she was in first
 we've got to figure something -- " he looked down at the fantastic semi-organic flora below
 he hurled drakeson back
 he'd still argue with drakeson about that
 as soon as he persuaded pat to abandon the flight
 greg's eyes misted as he brought the cruiser to a halfcrash landing
 he heard drakeson tearing through the tendrils
 and he heard the deadly chehoivwwthe last thing he remembered before the dark wrapped him up softly and warmly
 he raised himself to a sitting position
 he stared down a gloomy
 he breathed a deep sigh of temporary relief and triumph
 terror gripped greg then he remembered drakeson yelling at" him
 he didn't knov where he  was
 he felt the rigid pattern of tensed neck and jaw muscles
 if he could destroy
 he sank down
 he sat up stiffly
 he saw pat nichols
 he walked around and sat down beside greg
 pat came over and he took her hand
 he looked at pat
" he kissed her
 at thirteen he was prophesying events
 he canae to my desk during the midafternoon lull and said
" it was a dull day and he was such an apparently sincere little man that i decided to keep the conversation alive
" he grasped his umbrella in a manner indicating he meant to spear a dragon in case there were any around
" he didn't tell me what the other six were
 he came in out of the sunshine
 he came pattering out just before closing time and i was struck by the somber -- almost sad -- expression he wore
" he did something rarely done in science fiction -- made it sound convincing
 at thirteen he was prophesying events with alarming accuracy

 looking forward with joy to the long night ahead
 he stretched out on the hard floor and recorded the passing of the hours by the number of times the watchman went through
 then he climbed into the barrel at the front end of the packing line

 straight toward building a and the moon rocket

 rorrek knew the man's consciousness pattern
 rorrek handed the driver a dollar
 and laid a braceleted white arm across the table

 he decided perhaps that the basic terran-pattems could best be described by the goals they were inclined to favor

 they looked something like the eyes of an earth
 the skin was short and stiff and was a ft kind of silvery white
 then took the clip of shells which judd offered and slammed it into the chamber
 the little creature sat unmoving
 to survive it would have to be fast as hell and it would have to keep running all the time

 buckmaster leaned his shoulders back and then with sudden violence pulled his arms free from the guards' grip
 he slapped wagner across the mouth with his left hand and brought his right fist around in a short arc that crushed the bone in wagner's nose

 he wished that they had never turned back to earth at all
 this was just a lifeless memory of the earth he had known and loved

 he developed the first plates and compared them with the star charts of earth as it had been before they left it

 hugh was surprised that they had managed to come back to the ship without his hearing them

 "if any of them had started after us we would have crossed their paths already
 and picked up the pile of reports and the photographs he had just developed

 spud newlin had heard that a man could sometimes get rich overnight just tending bar on such occasions
 the night had had a good start

 only three moreor less innocent bystanders had been burned down in the proceedings
 when he had begun to doubt that she was allhuman
 he had found his way back to earth
 venus and wrested a niche of sorts within the citadcjls he had attempted to overthrow
 "i had expected more of newlin
 the best to he had
 she had chosen him on the basis of his reputation
 it was a long time since newlin had seen earth
 he had lost a finger and all the toes from his left foot in ceaseless guerilla warfare with rats which had disputed possession of the hold in which he stowed away
 more than once he had bummed passage near the atomic fuel vats of cranky old spacefreighters that were mere tin cans caulked with chewing gum
 brain and nimble fingers he had written an epic biography in security police annals
 the ugly savageries of venus had only a quaint charm
 newlin had stood within the strange world
 or of any world newlin had seen
 he had seen every planet or moon in the solar system
 whatever newlin had killed
 had the girl set the police on him
 newlin realized that the girl had anticipated everything
 the man -- or the thing -- had fired first
 he had a brief interval of grace in which to think things over and try
 actually they had started out by vehicle
 he had only the vaguest idea where they were
 and already newlin had established iron rations
 science years had passed since venus was a fair green planet peopled with hearty
 face people had even looked upon the sun
 ultimate exertion had taken toll of their energies and rapidly burned up air reserves
 newlin had been hunted before
 but we had colonies on venus
 thickened as if the air had become dense
 newlin had not spoken
 the symbols had been worked out and the science had been reduced to a game of "chess on paper
 lesser servants of the new state had learned caution and thus no regrettable deaths or rnaimings occurred
 at the time of his death that he had not been able to do that -- we are still certain

 he knew too the terror from which the last men of the human race had fled
 he had hunted in the great mountains of the moon
 he had stalked through empty martian cities

 the soldiers had already laid out the skeleton on a table
 in the martian desert -- on the long ' nights when he had lain

 parker could not determine what emotional overtone had found expression in retch's words
 look like the scientist he had claimed to be
 he had not known that retch was armed
 retch had introduced her as his secretary
 parker had the dazed impression that he saw the big blade jerked away through the air
 the heavy jolt the craft had taken when it struck the surface had twisted the whole frame
 his last jerk at the valve before mercedes dragged him under had opened it
 when retch had finished and had turned back to him
 into his mind had come a vision of a woman he had once known
" her name had been effra
 forced himself to think of what retch had said
 "she said she had made a forced landing on an island somewhere off the coast of southern gal
 the glance retch gave mercedes had no love in it
 the three men looked as if they had just stepped out of the #th century
 swash-buckling buccaneers who had somehow managed to survive their proper period in history and to live into the #th century
 three men coming from it had found them
" the last was spoken to parker as the dazed pilot tried to understand what had happened
 the one he had called gotch had spoken
 a ship that belonged to the days when spain had been draining the gold and silver and jewels of the new world into her coffers
 the two men who had been visible on the beach disappeared
 a monster on which spanish galleons and planes had been wrecked
 it was the most out-of-place sound bill parker had ever heard
 they were the queerest lot of human beings parker had ever seen
 mercedes had never been here before
 but retch had been jiere
 the same sleepy quiet sound that parker had heard as they landed
 parker saw that the man's face had turned gray
 that all the bristling bravado had passed out of him
 his own and the one he had taken from parker
 it blotted out the light of the stars and it looked a lot like a bird but like no bird he had ever seen before
 it was too big to be any bird that had ever flown through earth's air
 parker had the impression that
 it must have been cut into this cliff long before columbus had sailed westward
 the ledge turned into the cliff and became a tunnel that had been carved into solid stone
 the indian messenger of the night before had appeared in the tunnel
 it was one of the cleanest and most simply furnished rooms parker had ever seen
 rozeno had a thin nose
 in that split second he knew why retch had laughed so violently the night before
 when retch had said that he would go with them to see rozeno and ulnar
 a blow that had all the pilot's strength behind it
" swiftly parker explained what had happened
 parker had the feeling he was being weighed
 perhaps some other race -- had this island as an outpost
 one of the strangest control panels parker had ever seen
 then glanced back quickly at parker as if he reminded her of someone she had once known
 his mind had given him a flashing picture of the plane wrecked on the shore
 had taken one last desperate chance on finding her island
 setting her back on her feet was one of the hastiest movements he had ever made in his life
 he had found effra and she did not remember him
 parker had thought he had in his pocket the only two modern weapons on the island
" parker saw what he had not seen before
 "i should have killed that dog when i had the chance
 parker had never seen either of them before but their faces confirmed everything mercedes had said
 the men had disappeared from the ledge
 he had three old men
shot from a slot in the cliff had driven the two men downward
 some of these men had been pirates in their day
 they had known how to loot a tall ship
 they discovered they had been amateurs in the fine had needed a mah from the modern world to show them how the job ought to be done
 but it was like no bird he had ever seen in his life
 where a creature that had once looked hke a giant bird had flapped through the air now there was nothing
 this image -- it had been that of a great bird -- had suddenly vanished
 rozeno and ulnar had come back into the room to find parker and effra and mercedes already there
 effra had told parker
 they had seen johnny retch destroy the jezbro
 they had been master and servant but in the old days they had come up out of mexico together
 ulnar had taken death wounds before he was halfway across the room
 once it had been a little image in a niche beside the machine from the old time
 screaming met were suddenly trying to fight their way out of a place that had suddenly become haunted
 suddenly retch had three eyes
 the men who had run from this room were trying to regain their courage

 since the sun rotates on its axis in about # days

" said parn when they were back in the ark again
 and it differed only in detail from sahl's experience
 they sat locked in a small but comfortably furnished compartment until blast-off was accomplished and acceleration fell to something around a gravity
" she stuffed the gun in her belt and gave faron a warning look
 a small manlike creature with a huge head lay dead in a pool of red-brown blood near an instrument panel
 they would go in like a meteor and crash
 i'm going to kick your face in
 he took the capsules apart and emptied the white powder in alaia's mouth
 slipped in a couple of rods
 and the fellow's flesh is the ground it grows in
 i'll try to guide her in
 faron lay groaning in the corner
 and only a trace of twilight lingered in the west
 momentarily visible beyond a dip in the ridge
 there's lots of rustling in the brush
 the moon rose higher in the starflecked sky
 a dozen of the saffronskinned manlike creatures were beating about in the brush and talking among themselves
 raised in clamoring protest
 swelling louder with a change in the breeze
 or were they interpreting it in terms of their almost sub-human servants with the saffron hides
" alaia whispered in fright
 we're a couple of wolves -- wandering in their flocks
 a ball of fur hung in a nearby shrub
" he brought out a single stick of protein dehydrate and broke it in half
 ranging in age from a few weeks to eight years
 like the thing we saw in the brush
 the creature hung by a tentacle from a peg set in the wall
 saffron lies in the next room
 some trace of awareness remains in others of our kind
 we are certainly capable of manufacturing them in a very short time
 "is that the state of mind faron qun is in
 it and emptied the barrel in a moment
 the burly colonist came in and sat on him
 two others disgorged their "colonists" in different places on the day-side
 its night fires glowing in the dark
 squinted into the bright sunlight streaming in through the doorway
 nari stumbled against me like that day in the hut
 i will take nari back to our village in the sunset land
 better i should have stood in hollywood
 if there was a story in hoiman i wanted to get it without interference
 in the seventies my bum was slowing up
 and tell-tale potato crumbs were lodged in the whiskers on hoiman's unshaven chin
 before long i have a regular little circuit woiked up in the three spaceports
 but in that moment all the french fries left my plate
 so i get to thinking they oughta be terrific in the ring
 so the night of the match comes around and them martians insist on having it in their own town
 they stay up in the air by spinning like a wheel -- just like them flying saucers the rigellians was spying on us in the fifties
 holds him up in the air
 right away i knowed something was in the air besides that martian mangier
 until they isn't enough light in the house to see to strike a match
 so the colony cops put us in protective custody until they got the straight story
 so when my bum lifted their bum up in the air and spun him around like a pinwheel it was a big insult to them
 in the september issue
 so i took the time out to brew a pot of coffee while i finished dressing -- at least the coffee can was in plain view in the kitchen
 the throb in my head settled down into a dull ache
 jack and a half dozen other men -- my human foremen and supervisors -- were huddled in a worried bunch that broke up as soon as they saw me
 i thought of their taloned grip and put my own hands in my pockets
" the metal mouth gaped in what was undoubtedly an android smile
 somehow i didn't feel in the mood to bandy definitions with him
 there didn't seem to be much point in staying here any longer
 "cybernetics will fix them up in no time
 i called cybernetics and told them to put extra restraints in the conditioning lab
 i could call in the army
 somewhere in the back of my mind a glimmering of an idea began percolating
 an organizer -- #a -- appeared about noon and left soon after followed by every android in town
 it would wine out every android in the neighborhood
 i sat hoping that the #a's would give in
" jack came wearily in and dropped into a chair beside me
 city -- how long it seemed since i'd flown in there this morning
 at quarter to five in the morning my telephone rang
 just paling into a false dawn in the east
 there in the copter i was very much alone
 a little chef-type knelt in the dirt of a rich man's garden
 and the events of the last twenty-four hours must have been in his mind as well as in mine
 ing over a recently-concluded and intense seven-year course in science fiction during which we sought to serve the field both as author and editor
 and it is highly probable that the vast plurality of non-letter-writing men and women who keep science fiction magazines in business also i uve their pet peeves where stf i ties are concerned
 especially in china and the deccan peninsula
 o ne minor sample appeared last year in a weekly news magazine
 but to us it seems more logical that he came from the future equipped with a jacket that was in some way powered not only to keep him afloat and in motion but with some antigravity device that enabled him to lift the heavy logs as if they were made of cork or balsa
 at which some of our more excitable readers wrote in to this effect -- "gee whizz -- a thousand generations
 "those orifaces in the upper portion of its skull are evidently organs of sight
" slowly -- slowly -- the native's head rotated away from them in a half-circle until it faced toolls
 it raised its right foot in a slow arc
 oncfe again its head turned in its slow quarter-circle
 "this is the sixth time it has tried to escape -- in exactly the same way
 "i think that i may have broken the bone in several places when i first captured it
 moving in odd
 "i wish we were returning this way in a thousand years or so
 "our next stopping place -- the red star -- will reach its nearest conjunction with this planet by the time we meet it out in space
 the final result was that they evolved into beings best able to survive in that environment
 but it was tough on the folks in tibet
 joy and i will be on the way to europe in pursuit of a most elusive honeymoon
 she no doubt would have added -- 'in that tone of voice
" joy cut in
 which was given by my aunt gretchen in the big house on shore drive
 i took joy in my arms and kissed her
 "tell me -- " "babe -- the kid could be the next heavyweight champ in a breeze
 he busts right through the wall and lands in a frail's lap inside who's -- " "powdering her nose
 but joy took the bottle from me in a rather dazed manner
" it sounded like a good suggestion so we stiffened our spines with w hat was left in the bottle
 they's two really tough monkeys in this town
 seeing them both in one place is like seeno ing truman and that music critic sit down at the piano together
 and the light of battle in her eyes
 she was holding a plate of jello in one hand and a liottle of beer in the other and was shouting in outraged dignity
 she was fully dressed now and i was struck by the peculiar manner in which this peculiar team functioned
 i felt a sharp dig in the ribs
 the masked' man stared in slack-jawed wonder
 uncle peter evinced bright interest and made two more check marks in the book
 tomori  w every juke box in town can play 'nearer my god to thee
 he sent rulie back to call the ark
 and they varied in he said suddenly
 he held it out and stared at morgun sahl
 was he even bom on earth
" he hung up and yelled at the others
" he bellowed into the intercom
" he called back through the hatch
 he scrambled up into the lock and stood gazing back toward the ark as parn climbed up after him
 somehow he could not believe that the fellow was not originally descended of earth stock
" he handed her the gun and nodded
" he climbed to the duct opening and glanced along it
" he tossed faron the eridanian's weapon and stepped through the hatch
 he turned away white-faced to stare at the biologist
 as he knelt beside alaia
" he glanced down at the girl
 he glanced at faron who was staring at the instruments
" he hurried out of the cabin and returned a moment later
" he stared at the screen
 he pried open its jaw and stared
 he made a neat incision in the throat
 he sat braced against the wall
" he nodded and walked to the rim of the gorge
 and by its faint light he saw the dim whiteness of a small waterfall
 peering out at the night he caught a glimpse of the winking lights
" he crawled closer toward the opening and stared
" with a worried grunt he crawled back to where she lay
 he slipped his hand down the neck of her suit and felt along the smooth skin until he found it -- a rough scaly little disk that clung tight to her back
 he laid it on a rock and burned it
 he finally spotted them a hundred yards away
 he guessed it to be' at least fifty thousand years
" he nodded in the darkness
 he crawled to the opening and stared across the hilltops and beyond them toward a plain
 he trotted out toward the brush
 he could just comfortably reach the third
 he scrambled up the last step and stood in a narrow pathway that ran along the eight-foot wall
 he caught a glimpse of two orange-tinted children toddling across the moss-covered turf
 he sat on the wall and beckoned to alaia
" she gasped as he helped her up to the top of the wall
" he leaped down to the mossy turf and caught her arm as she followed
 but he caught her hand on its way to her mouth
 he caught sight of a saffron adult wandering among the trees -- a man
 he saw one incident that he could only interpret as a release-shock phenomenon
 and he nodded slightly to himself
 he saw that it meant to attack him
" sahl growled weakly as he lay on something soft and stared at a
 when at last he subsided
 then he lay weakly struggling to keep some sort of mental balance
 he lay staring blankly at the ceiling
" he sat up quickly
 he had a fair idea of what would happen if he tried to e
" he heard a faint sob
 he's gone berserk
 as he stared
 he hung panting on the rail
 he heard a faint buzz of power
 although he was not quite aware of what he had lost
" he paused to glance back at the biologist with mixed emotion
 he spent the next five minutes talking about the hard time he had endured trying to handle the restless colonists during the delegation's absence
 he nodded slighly and obeyed
 why should he put up such a howl when that second piszjil again
 he was -- " sahl sat up with a sudden shudder
 and faron -- if he wants to
 a little man who made scarcely a sound as he slid into my booth and sat facing me
 he was pouring a second glass of beer
 see:' -- hard as the rocks he juggles around in the daytime
 he was stronger'n my bum
 but he knows how to kick
 the big miner gets a head scissors on him and like to moiders him before he can submit
 and he passes the word around that my bum has plenty moxie
 and he don't slip none clamping it on -- at first
 but one day he tells me he keeps feeling them eyes on him while he's rasslin'
 he says iffen he has to he'll use his pretzel bend
 and he has a hammerlock and an arm strangle both on my bum -- and both of them keylocked 
 so i tell him how to get that next fall -- to keep away from them four arms and keep circling until he gets a chance to clamp on the pretzel bend
 he lets the martian have a rabbit punch
 and he gives him some more knee lifts and a drop kick or two
 he bangs that martian around with elbow smashes and knee lifts till he don't know is he on one leg or six
 he emptied the last bottle of beer
 they took it that my bum was as much as telling them that he didn't think they was any better than them insecks flying around over the ring
 and the colony administrator lifts all our scratch -- said we'd gummed up martian trade and he'da trun us in the clink too only he didn't want to see no more of us
 he wouldn'ta even give us fare back to earth except he said he didn't want us anywhere on mars
 who hovered nearby on the chance that he'd stop talking and give her an inning
 he'd scarcely slipped out through the door when sherry moved in
 he'd left my house before dawp
 he was already reaching for the bottle when he remembered
" once again he nodded
 he stood awaiting me -- very tall
" into that strange android grin as he added
 if he does he will ultimately be depriving himself of any stf reading at all
 or should he be left without any knowledge of us
 he is impervious to sickness
 he will probably live approximately twice that long
 he lives in a small bungalow at the edge of town
 he has the audacity to claim you invited him to -- to this brawl as he terms it
" "if he seemed a trifle peculiar
 and tessie's hot to kiss him wid a bottle when he pulls the iron
" "i gathered that was what he meant
 who could not come because this is the day he reports to the parole board
 t he crowd at the buffet surged back and i saw a bucktoothed hooligan bent double
" he motioned with the gun barrel and i drew joy toward the wall
 he made a check mark in the book
 he gave us a sickly smile
 he likes 'em blonde and -- " bag ears was on the move again
" he told us
 so she tipped hands off that he could find the whole zinsky mob at the reception
 "i'd suggest you get out and slug that cop quick and grab uncle peter before he makes a confession
 he wasted no time in getting acquainted
 it wasn't too good a target because he had a lantern jaw and it was bobbing up and down as he munched on a wad of chewing gum
 maybe he plans to clean out the whole town
 picked it up three blocks further on as it came wheeling out of a side "okay -- where is he
 t he blonde sat behind the wheel with a sullen look on her face
 did he blow up
 he didn't think pete could do it -- blow people into thin air just from somealong with the gag but he wasn't going to pass up an opportunity to rub out the zinsky gang -- or as many as he could hit -- if the gimmick didn't click
 that's why he brought the tommy -- just in case
" he raised the glass and grinned
 i doubt if he'll come to the station peaceably
 he merely picked them up here and i set them down in tibet
 once or twice he grinned back at them
" he told larkin
" t he martian came forward
 he did not like larkin personally
 he picked up the pitcher and poured beer into the glasses
 he raised an arm to shield off the whip
" he fired three bullets into the martian's brain
 rhythmic noises which he could not doubt were speech of some kind or other -- a rasping
 he sat there for perhaps two hours when he received the distant impression that someone was talking to him in his own language
 he meant to give mcllvaine a harder time than ever
 so he went back to the machine and guru and the little excursions to bixby's
" he went home that night filled with anticipation
 and he sat waiting for what he was certain must be the experience above all others in his prosaic existence
 he never did give us any precise address-
 he just mentioned detroit once
 he said he had some interest in astronomy and meant to develop that if time permitted
 a kind of expression that seemed to say there was something he ought to know
 that he resorted to all sorts of magic tricks to help him gain the upper hand
 and he seemed to suddenly have absorbed -- even if unconsciously -- the idea of abstract thinking
 evidence of the things of which he wrote continues to pile up
" "he was dangerous to us
 he threatened to submit it direct
 he smiled and gestured toward two adjoining chairs
 he removed handles from mary's head
 from the bottle he took two large pills and swallow'ed them
 this must be what he meant
 then he turned to mary again
 major reynolds t he red headed secretary asked
 ted baker held out the small steel box he was carrying
 he's a clerk in a supermart
" he didn't bother using the intercom
" bill stopped what he was doing
 "he said he'd call us
 the way he treated us
 he treated us swell
 he did us a big favor
" he turned back to tam
 he'd find some courage
 he reflected wearily as he shuffled into the tunnel
 would take a lot of courage -- t he girl at the desk glanced up at him
 slowly he looked around the neat office
 and he felt her eyes on his back as he shuffled over and sat down
 making the printing as neat as he could with the old-style vacuum pen provided
 then he sat back and waited
 he glanced anxiously at the clock as another man was admitted to the small back office
 and he rose and walked over to the desk
 and he sat forward
 at last he turned into a small downtown bar and sank wearily onto a stool near the door
 checked an address in the thick new denver book -- he knew he looked frightful as he stepped onto the elevator
 he just stared ahead at the moving panel
 he pushed a cigar box across the desk
 he didn't look at tam
" he looked straight at tam
 and he stared at the man behind the desk
" he stared at tam
 and maybe some paper to wjte on -- " he stared at the big man
 he didn't know why he was afraid
 he too hoped that they were near earth
 that means alpha centauri must be -- " he paused
 he pointed that lay beyond alpha centauri on the plates
 he realized suddenly that he had more than half expected to see an empty orbit
 he turned back to the screen and stared at the still featureless dot that was the earth
" he stared down at the topoggraphy thousands of miles below them
 as aware of all the people as if he were out in the corridors with them
 he looked up at the sky and at all the stars that he couldn't see and he cursed them all and cursed time itself and then
 he too was in the grip of habit
 he inserted the first plate and snapped the picture of the stars whose names he knew but whose patterns were wrong
 he glanced down at the reports on the table
 slowly the dazed look died out of their eyes as they realized what he meant
" he walked along the row of tanks until he came to the one he was searching for
 and then he picked up a glass cylinder and filled it from the tank
 they crossed to the nearest lock and he pushed the button that opened it
 he nodded slowly and lifted the glass cylinder he had brought from the ship and stared at it
" he nodded again
" slowly he unstoppered the cylinder and knelt down at the water's edge
 then he tipped the bottle up and poured
" he looked down at the empty cylinder that he had dropped at the water's edge and then he looked out at the ocean
 he would be amazed as the father of science fiction as it is known today
 he received an adequate education
 he must be considered along with the time in which he lived
 so he's the guy who calls himself the great democratic liberator

 went along the companionway at a run
 but the second was wary
 up the companionway they pounded
 and brought up against the wall at the foot of the stairs to the upper deck and the bridge
 but the second was too frightened to let a little thing like a fall stop him
 caught the second under the chin and he came down the stair like a sack of meal

 destroy the company's monopoly
 the answer is simple -- we must get back to earth
 the government might look upon us as mutineers and thus give the company a chance to quash the whole affair
 we must land on earth with the biggest possible splurge of publicity
 i say let's decide here and now that the only thing we will do is go back to earth
 the room rang with the shouts of approval

 and the crew was hurled against the wall and pinned there as the continuing involuntary maneuver built up acceleration

 the ship's unnatural veering stopped instantly and both maher and gene dropped heavily to the floor

 the three prisoners were reported unharmed
 and they left the room behind maher and schwenky
 gene faced the rest
 put on pressure suits and come with me he led the way to the locker containing the pressure suits
 those who were not too deformed to don the suits
 the air rushed out as the door swung open
 to return to the deck above and cut through with a torch
 "that'll give us some idea of how the people back on earth will receive us" said gene
 if any of the company ships sight us
 i think i can manage the rest
 this time directly toward the  # ball of earth
 and the air on the deck above rushed out through the hole they had burned into the cabin

 analysis had shown the presence of copper and aluminum in the top surface of some of the markers that could only be accounted for by some metallic object setting atop each one long ago
 at the same time i said
 the other part was frozen with horror
 approximately a half acre of the cemetery was glowing
 melting and evaporating at the same time
 none of the others found what they rationalized themselves into thinking they remembered from the time they were martians
 they look at something and the idea of familiarity associates with the new impression
 there was a car to take her back to the hotel

 for the sight which met our eyes was certainly the last thing i had expected to see
 for what seemed like minutes we just stared
 for a good minute we waited tense
 we recoiled from the edge and braced for a stronger earthquake shock
 and then became conscious for the first time of the sound
 for a second we were all still -- we four
 for a time we just breathed heavily -- ourselves and our brown skinned captors alike
 for the first few minutes no one had anything to say
" i had forgotten for the moment that i was a zoologist
 there was every chance for a mistake
 he glanced about for a moment
 and for a time the embarrassing matter seemed solved

 but perhaps you can try to imagine that our feelings were not entirely those of ambitious schemers -- that perhaps within us was some higher motive for the step we took
 here we brought physicians and scholars to care for him and plan his education
 for a time indeed we feared that it would never stop and that he would die of starvation when the world could no longer feed him
 for a time also we were sure diat he would never be able to stand
 for a second i thought insanely of flight
 "nothing we can do until they come for us
 we listened at the door for footsteps but none came
 for a full minute we stared at each other
 so startled us that for a moment nobody could think of a reply
" "we have time for nothing else
 for a breathless fifteen seconds we were carried in darkness
 from our position on the concrete platform i now looked closely at kazu for the first time
" kazu thought of this for a moment
 i do not wish to use this strength for evil
 but that obviously he could not make one large enough for kazu to see
 when we had the immense furniture for comparison
 adapted for writing or drawing on the glass slide while it was being projected
 for a moment i thought that kazu might see us
 but baker neatly tripped him and then stepped back for kazu to finish the job
 for the moment the young giant seemed to have taken a liking to us
 "phobat rau plans for me to go soon to head armies of asia in fight against west
 evidently realizing that this was no time for philosophic quibbling
 what they were waiting for evidently struck kazu and us at the same time
 they're running off -- " the next second things happened too rapidly for translation or even immediate interpretation
 for abruptly he scrambled up the steep hillside and pulverized gun
 the situation for us was made much worse because at first we doubted both his sincerity and good sense -- in fact
 for each square inch
 for kazu carefully held our steel box above the sea
 and entirely given over to rice growing for kazu's food supply
 let me look for a chart
 for the distant shore could hardly be less than seventy miles away
 for the water was little more than knee deep and kazu towered fully four hundred feet above it
 t he nautical charts did not show much detail for the interior of celebes
 but unfortunately most of it was too deep for kazu to wade
 and he had to swim for a time
 we were all taking time for the luxury of a sigh of relief when chamberlin screamed a warning
 i became conscious for the first time of a curious change
 we followed the course of the kapuas river for a time
 and so for a second time we sought out an isolated valley where kazu could snuggle between two soft hills
" baker drew up an empty film box for a seat
way back this time -- be a bit awktrd for us if he doesn't
 for it was stoked with several logs fully eight feet in diameter and was sending flames fifty feet into the sky
 "at every temple they collect rice for buddha

 baker insisted on sampling each course rather extensively for sleeping potions or poison

 we followed the ridge of these mountains for a time
 and for a time were greatly slowed by what appeared to be thick gumbo
 terrain which had protected the lush plains of china for centuries against the mongols
 we followed the wall for almost two hundred miles -- all the way
 to the latitude of peking -- before we swung east again for the final lap to mao's capital
 and then raised our box to ask for advice
 slept for a time
 it took a moment or so for kazu to ict his hearings
 kazu stopped speaking and braced his shoulders for the blast
 for he did not speak again for a long time
 for the western side of that vast desert was closed by a range of mountains # feet high
 our altitude would be above six thousand feet for many miles
 here kazu paused for a drink
 were combing the eastern gobi for the body
 whose grim face relaxed for the first time in a fleeting grin
 kazu stood for a moment surveying this famous scene
 for their faces had gone round the world in po
 for he looked at baker searchingly for a moment

 lora says you're all right
 you can't keep this sort of thing quiet
 you with the beard
 "i have an odd paradox for you
 if you know any way to stop a plane from falling you tell me
 "i think it's a lot like the mirages you see on the desert
 you told me that you knew where this island was located but you didn't tell me it had a bad habit of vanishing
 "will you remember one thing
 you told me you were a scientist and that you wanted to investigate certain phenomena on this island
 are you a scientist
 didn't i tell you -- " "what kind of a scientist are you
 are you a biologist
" c j # "i don't believe you ire a scientist at all
 you don't talk like one

 the former having twelve members including you
 you can't really tell the merits of a mag by its first issue
 do you give two hoots what i think

 and i think you'll agree that one hundred years
 check any old grain chart and you'll see what i mean
 today i take you'
 "because i can't spend too much time with you without stirring up suspicion
 hope avery didn't give you too wild a ride
 but i thought it best not to advertise my interest in you at the front door
 avery will show you to your rooms
 i refer to the cloak and dagger method of getting you here
 if you went to a hotel in new macassar
 you wouldn't be alive tomorrow morning
 or get you on the shanghai plane
 "you're well briefed on the general situation
 "you're aware of the efforts that have been made to look into the crater on yat
 naturally nobody believed that you were just after celebese man
 you'll have geiger counters and a krypton analyser of course
 so that you'll have a better chance of getting past the beach
 if you reach the rim
 if you miss that time
 if by chair you understand me to mean a boxlike building twenty stories high
 "you spend nice night
 head lama talk to you now
 so you doubt that he is alive
 perhaps you would like a second look
 if you can spare the time
 perhaps you recall what happened on that day

 'how dare you poison buddha' -- look

 i'd like you to meet kazu takahashi
 "if you will enter your airplane and start jets
 "i don't think you'll find general mao here
 "you can make it by nine
 "you will not live to gloat over us
 you better hurry or i get to washington first
 when it came to you one day that this was so
 "you'll wipe out the only chance we have to survive
 you've got the sign that can't be taken off -- you're one of them
 "what do you want with us
 "you're a scientist
 if you are -- one of them -- you should have been able to remove the wound yourself
 "don't waste time -- " "but you wear the black question mark
 you would be useful at mount gabriel
 "you wjint me to die
 i want you to die
 you want to see me die
 three thousand points -- when you were supposed to be always within one day's point of a balance
 you were allowed twelve hundred points a day
 you got even one day
 but the next day you had to start all over
 "you've hurt my lame foot
 all you had to do was put your credit card in a machine
 you can call me penelope
 once a day you turn your slips into central and the machine audits your account
 "why do you think i sit out there and put on my act all day long
 "don't you stumble over my lame foot
 you've lost two hundred points this week
 you don't even dare to get into a fight
 somebody would collect a thousand points every time you hit him
 you give me twenty per cent
 "i met you at central concourse two years ago
 i have a feeling you shouldn't have gone over a hundred thousand
 "you have now a hundred and twenty-two thousand
 see you in the morning
 you mean there'll be something to do all the time
 why don't you sit down a minute while we let it soak in
 you'll find out everything tomorrow
 "see you tomorrow at central
 you could have collected two thousand from that last one
 "an' you'll keep on bein' in the right place at the right time
 but we had not been in the city a half hour before we sensed something else
 it was as major reid had written before we irft san francisco -- a subtle change had come over asia in the previous few years
 and had permission from the republic of east asia to do some work on celebese man
 and had communicated their fears to their home governments
 at first it had been nationalism
 yellow robed buddhist priests had always been common
 we sensed that it had been japanese
 we had received a similar briefing in washington
 ington had told us a good many other things
 but some had special privileges and were allowed to go to the top of the crater rim
 who had the best command of chinese
 he had been speaking in the cantonese dialect
" baker turned from the mirror where he had been adjusting his tie
 i've had to pull a diplomatic boner of the first magnitude
 and if i had seen the kyoto buddha
" martin had been studying the photograph
 stimson had built us up to something -- just what
" we were driven to the harbor in the same disreputable taxicab which had brought us to the consulate a few hours before
 so that the only indication we had that yat was at hand was a slight deepening in the tropic night ahead and to the right
 but no sooner had we gotten this vaguely orienting information
 this had been provided for us
 we had an hour and twenty-three minutes to moonrise
" the slope had now steepened considerably
 walt had squeezed in beside me
 until the last windy sigh had died away
 but the ledge of rock down which we had just fallen stood in the way
 our captors had split themselves into two groups
 the whole thing had been a little outside of the type of specimen i was familiar with
" martin and chamberlin had a few more remarks of the same nature
 i had little doubt as to our ultimate fate
 so that i had no idea of how long they kept us in the cell it could not have been too many hours
 he placed them carefully in the position we had noted last night
 who had been watching us with great amusement
 although the daily milk ration had to be increased twice
 after a generous contribution had been made by father takahashi
 had perhaps a bit more imagination than some others
 but first i had to convince others
 but year by year we had to revise our estimates
 we had to appeal to the western world
 russia had yat at its mercy
 iv after the steel door had clicked shut that the full realization of our predicament came to us
" this unpleasant thought had not occurred to the rest of us before
 the same one who had brought us here originally -- came in
 "i have not before had opportunity to talk to men from west
" q uite definitely i had no desire to go in
 we all knew that rau had not given up
 none of us had realized how long we had been in the projection room
 we fell to even before kazu had gotten his ponderous spoon into position
 the surf which had used us so violently was to him only a half inch ripple
 i had little doubt as to what would happen to him
 which at # feet was the greatest mountain kazu had ever seen
 by the time we had reached a temporary haven
 martin had started a big campfire outside
 but now baker had more practical questions
 where he had caught it in midair
 then a statement by some lama on macassar that the british had kidnaped buddha
 the communist propaganda factory had obviously been caught flat footed
 kazu extinguished the fire so that no one else would be attracted as the colonel had been
 colonel faulkner's intention had been to circle us rather than leave us behind with his superior speed
 and the colonel had to gun his motors to keep up
 kazu had been here before
 but either the idea had not occurred to the communists
 who since the days of the first stalin had sought to enslave china with lies and trickery
" colonel faulkner had landed at the hankow airport and now
 had been put down by the communists with the aid of air support coming directly from russia
 here the great wall had been built
 the shanghai garrison had sprung a trap on their disorganized attackers
 there had been reports of increasing soviet air activity over the area
 by this time the noise of the planes had increased to a roar
 a pinkish line of light had now appeared along the eastern horizon which
 the leading plane had dropped something -- a black spherical object above which blossomed a parachute
 baker lost whatever calm he had left and screamed
 by the time we had cleared the city
 the armies which had been poised last night had finally met
 to the back that had taken the full brunt of heat and gamma radiation
 about kazu's feet was a shallow ravine in which a thousand or so communist troops had taken cover
 but it seemed that for the most part the soldiers had been sheltered from direct radiation by the wall of their canyon
 word that a russian plane had atom bombed the new buddha spread across china
 at first it was believed that buddha had died instantly
 later rumor had it that he had crawled off to mongolia to die
 the horror of what had been done was too much even for that well oiled propaganda machine
 at last a line was patched together: the bomb had been dropped by an american plane
 then radio peking announced that chinese fighters had shot it down and that the crew was russian
 by ten o'clock he had put a thousand miles between him and the coast and was well across the southern gobi desert
 who had been almost as stunned as kazu
 he had nothing for central asia as detailed as the charts we had used in borneo and celebes
 things had calmed down quite a bit
 evidently no word of our trip across all of central asia had been received
 but now kazu had found what he wanted
 the last was the man who had succeeded stalin on his death
 a deep weariness and a bewilderment was upon it -- as though kazu had suddenly sickened of destruction and slaughter
 chamberlin had been an army pilot in the fifties
 then news from the tiny river settlement of zhigansk on the lena that he had passed
 he's had a bad burn outside
 although it seemed clear that kazu had headed south
 kazu had vanished
 he passed a building that had died in the last war
 on the back was an editorial that told why earth forces had been compelled to destroy all the martians
 they had been watching him since his arrival
 his father had been a scientist
 told him that someone had known his father was a scientist
 night had closed in over the courtyard
 lukey's shot -- missing jordan -- had struck him
 henry and lukey and the inn had been deadly
 the pain from the wound had been reduced to a steady ache
 even with the rest he had gotten
 two words had been added -- painted on in a hasty scrawl
" jordan saw that the liquid had made his woimd flesh-colored
 all three of the dogs had bullet holes in their heads
 and jordan knew they had a chance
 and had been for twenty years -- but one of the jewelry windows and the door
 and for five straight days the balance had been in red
 all of a sudden mark had been scared
 the way penelope had flavored it with enzymes
 that day he had gathered fifty-one hundred points
 he felt sorry for the poor suckers who had to get out at sunup and tread the sidewalks until dark to get enough points to satisfy central
 mark adjudged the time had come
 he located the woman who had made a raspberry in the little man's face and collected another two thousand
 then mark spotted two others who had made threatening noises and collected five hundred from each
 penelope had recovered enough to gasp
" penelope had a can of synthetic meat in her hands
 the last time he had given away fifty thousand points to a fellow who claimed a broken back
 blackie led them to the ambush he had chosen that morning
 they had picked up an escort of dirty
 if they had used plan k -- " the old man snorted
 if they had time to think
 a hush had fallen over i
 the course had already been chosen and fed into the automatic computers under him
 this had been the first battle ever fought under the whiplash of plan k
 but the old man had ceased smiling by that time
 they only had to wait a couple of hours and the whole kit and caboodle would have been dumped in their laps
 i remembered they had broken the code of the first channel
" leonardo made no comment on the fact that his own fortunes had been drained by the invasion
 he wrote: "when i thought i had been learning how to live -- i had only been learning to die
 the following night it was magnitude # and the coma had doubled in extent
 then it began to grow fainter and by february # had dropped to magnitude # again
 instead of clearing up the mystery the spectrograms had only served to deepen it
 the former had a definitely unique twist
 by now this letter is too long to even stand a chance of being printed but as long as i've had my say i'm satisfied
 many of the leading scientists in america have had a whack at it
 someone had sugfloated a note to ivan ix in a bottle
 what changes had occurred behind the hell wall
 since the last big peace-effort which had ended in stalemate and total isolation
 it was said that the third ivan had been a crafty opportunist but also a wise man who
 effected a bloody reformation in which the hair-splitting marxist dogmatics had been purged
 a slogan had leaked across the wall recently: "there is no god but a practical man
" and it seemed to affirm that the third ivan's influence had continued after his passing -- although the slogan itself was a dogma
 the forty years of noncommunication had not been spent in military stasis
 the seventh john smith had even conspired to have a conspiracy against himself in argentina
 so that the weapons could be tested under actual battle conditions -- for the region had been overpopulated anyway
 the results had been comforting -- but john the sixteenth wanted to know more about what the enemy was doing
 which had been set up on short notice for this one broadcast
 he was glad the soviet worker's vicar had not responded to his first politeness
 congress had not been assembled for fifteen years
 which had changed its combination since the last time
 a feeling of uneasy security had evolved
 and the east had become a mysterious unknown
 the mysteriousness of the foe had been used politically to good advantage by every president selected to office
 and the sixteenth smith had intended to so use it
 he would not have had to worry about the spy-matter
 the subversive work had not begun yesterday
 he had to go ahead and fight it instead of allowing it to pass on to the next john smith
 their cowls and robes had been affected during the last great peace-effort
 at which time they had been impregnated with lead to protect against bombradiation
 one had murdered a deputy who came to question him
 had spectacularly committed suicide by exploding an atomic artillery shell
 since number six had died mysteriously in the bathtub -- to leave the study so that he might unmask
 perhaps the talks had best be broken off
 the peoplesfriend had nothing to gain by revealing the military strength of his own hemisphere
 andrei sorkin had been a physicist who had done considerable work in crystal-structure before the big silence had cut off knowledge of his activities from the west
 seemed to suggest that the east had made great strides in servo-mechanisms and auto-control devices
 he concluded that ivan had not meant it to make much sense
" "three men -- volunteers for the project -- vanished as soon as they found out that they had to submit to all the physicals
 two of the men had been caught attempting to escape
 they had been lodged in a local jail to await transfer to the capitol
 somehow they had gotten incendiary materials into their cells
 he had spoken to the asian leader several times
 about one percent of the west's population had been executed
 the following day he had only seven stand-ins
 four and eight had been trapped in a burning building on the outskirts of the rabble city
 the idea of contacting ivan had started
 but how had the idea first come to him
 had one of the guilty stand-ins perhaps planted the seed in his mind
 they had seemed demurring at first
 then climbed lazily aloft like a beetle that had ridden the eagle
" other people had come out of their myra laughed lightly -- a calcuhomes also
 even though such things had happened before even gun powder was invented
 they knew that the places where the bombs had fallen were guarded like fort knox
 they had been in bed three hours
 because all they could think of as soon as they had eaten was getting into bed and staying there until the last possible minute on the following morning
 hugh hadn't changed a great deal from the gangling kid who never studied mathematics in school but always had the answers

 so the five pieces of heavy star had a rendezvous with a world unborn
 university offered a reward of one hundred dollars to anyone who had seen him
 it had a balance of three thousand eight hundred and forty dollars

 it also had a withdrawal of three hundred and twenty dollars two days before the disappearance
 this avenue of exploration came to an abrupt end with the discovery that he had traded in his last yea:is car on a new one
 after the third day the blackboard had been erased and the classroom released for its regular classes
 they passed martin grant by because they had heard from him in their initial work
 no bomb has ever been invented -- and there's no possibility of one ever coming up -- which will knock the seams of this planet apart
 no weapon of destruction will ever be devised which can do the damage that one small tremor of nature can accomplish : like the san francisco earthquake

 t he next day conger went walking along the one main street of cooper creek

 retch's head was twisted to one side
 caught himself on one of the handmade chairs
 parker pulled himself to one knee
 he brought one fist down into the other fist
 knowledge that would help the human race become what it must one day be

 no one now alive understands it
 understanding is one of the things i hope your scientists may achieve -- come away
 parker took one look at the contents of this room
 ulnar was one of montezuma's most trusted sub-chiefs
" "tell me one thing
 one last lonely flight out over the pacific
" one of the two protested
 one of the men was killed
 the expression of surprise became one of agony
 one appeared at the opening
 her fingers went to one of the little statuettes
 was one thing this instant
 "this is one of the hardest things to do
 he took one of the two pistols
 it seemed to him that there was only one answer
 retch slid to one side
 with one savage thrust
 one of them was in the middle of his forehead
 one of the men who had tried to steal the treasure of montezuma
 one of the men who had followed johnny retch
 on a balcony in front of one of the window slots
 and bring them here one by one

 the presence of the f-#a at this particular instant was just one of those pilot realized this

 although a damned good one
 one of a group strung across the shallow sea east of borneo and north of celebese
 presently one of the swells picked us up quite gently
 after inspecting one of the posts for signs of electrification
 one of these appeared to be a steel bowl-like container some thirty feet deep and a hundred in diameter
 at one instant we were sane humans
 although baker claims to be the guilty one
 then one of the latter spoke
 soon there appeared a metal door in one wall
 the one who spoke pidgin english
 "there was one case
 was the one controlling growth
 "the summer of # was one of increasing difficulty for the temple
 but with one reservation
 one look at the cold mongol faces of the guards was enough to dispel any hope
 he reached one arm in as far as possible
" as no one else seemed anxious to pursue this subject further
 buddha extended one hand
 with one accord we leaped over the parapet just as a scattered volley of pistol shots rang out
 my first impression was not so much one of size
 one of the latter was
 "no one

 and then lashed out with one foot
 and there was one wound a yard long from which oozed a sticky gelatinous blood

 one hand reached behind him
 he raised one foot

 basils at one end
 reached down and pulled the roof from one of the buildings
 one by one they made the leap
 the one called stalin understood the german
 only one of them replied
 he was the only one
 ashamed of what one people can do to another people
 they looked at him and whispered to one another
 one leaned back against the wall in a chair
 looking at the dusty spinning wheel in one comer
" one long knotty hand constricted
 "first we find out if he's one of them
 this is one more we'll repay
 "i am one of them
 one arm was clutched to his body
 he stumbled up one dark hill
 a thousand hills -- unfriendly -- each one higher and steeper than the last
 t he first sensation was one of heat
 he opened one eye
 the girl laughed shortly and pulled down one side of her blouse
 "i trust you because no one who was in his right mind would purposely have that brand on him
 no one goes there any more
 and a stack or iron cannonballs decorated one comer
" one of them said
 blue wisps of smoke floated under one of the lamp posts
" he pointed off to the right with one hand
 jordan took one side
 they turned one more corner
 a wooden vampire stake hung on one wall
 because i'm one of them
 he picked up one of the scalpels after cleaning off the wound
 down one last alley
 he touched the soft warm fur of one dog
 one blackcoated arm hung loosely
 "in one way
 "of course he's right in one way
 behind one jutting shoulderblade was the mark
 great blue pistol in one hand
" no one spoke as they walked out of the old house
 then dragged one of his pistols free and pointed it at her

 at least a dozen novels and hundreds of short stories have been based directly or indirectly on ideas set forth in fort's four books -- lo
 this would seem to mitigate against hoaxing in any marked degree by fort himself
 the number of fortean occurrences in recent years has been startling
 in one department alone -- the flying saucers -- more phenomena have accumulated in the last four years than in the preceding century
 only w'oollcott and hecht dabbled in the field of fantasy
 but such men are few in the fortean ranks and have nothing whatever to do with running the society
 but not in the least along fortean lines

 none of which ever appeared in the fortean magazine
 fort wasn't interested in enslaving populations
 although an occasional article creeps in by other authors -- mainly mathematical and usually unintelligible
 extracts from the notes of fort are published in a special section in the rear of each issue
 the references done in a cryptic sort of shorthand
 since fort eschewed politics wholly and never wrote a line in that direction
 sniped at the allied side in every issue

 three languages splashed pungently in dispute which passed quickly to a climax of crisscrossed heat-beam both the fat martian and his adversary from ganymede survived
 "i'm just in from -- earth

 risking the unpleasant death from leaking radioactives in preference to being poor on earth
 there was pride in her
 each unit sat alone in sprawling
 landscajjed with flowering trees and set with the chill sophistication of statuary in gold
 newlin stood alone in the center of a vast area
 in which stood a tall shadow
 sound in nerve-shattering symphonies like the tinkling clatter of many chinese windbells of glass
 in a peculiar way
 by dawn he would very likely be crumpled among the ashcans and refuse in any dark alley
 police care little who is murdered in the nameless dives of venusport
 the scant shelter of shadows in deserted alleyways was a comfort
 in the old native quarter
 he turned the last alley-corner and came in sight of the spacebell
 but the rest is all in credits
 in the first flurry of sandstorm
 the terraced gardens afid the palaces -- as if they still stood today as they were in that vanished yesterday
 newlin stared at a pale flickering in the dust ahead
 convulsions stopped as short-circuits flared in both head and body
 its metallic carcass glowed eerily in the dimness
 it blazed up in a fireworks display' spectacular enough to attract half of venus to the terrified fugitives
 uneasiness stirred in newlin
" songeen's laugh was a ripple of eery crystal in the darkness

 and the emotional effect was not religious in any sense -- it was stark

 our world exists in the same plane as yours
 and all who dwell in it are lunatics
" she shobk her head in curious ruffle of emotion
 a void appearing in the air itself
 all around him was a maze of shimmering crystal in odd forms
 he waited while her glance swung about the room
 but he must have the chance
 too well he knew what they meant
 he stared at her as weariness and disgust strangled him
 and what sort of man could he be
 he could trace a vague outline of encirclement
 he stared at the man he had come to see
 he stared and the man stared back
 he leaped upon newlin and thrust him back
 he went through the still-open airlock doors and out into the screaming night
 he wondered if they would risk another such expensive machine merely to hunt down a murderer in the wastelands
 he was not certain if it would be inhabited at the sandstorm season
 he stopped and motioned the girl to rest
 he was aware that songeen operated some hidden mechanism
 neither by vision or hearing could he distinguish anything
 "he was not the first
" he ordered roughly
 he shouted in loud defense
 he was aware of the utter strangeness behind this forest and its crystalline mysteries
 he was aware of bodily movement and the crowding feel of shadowy aisles about him
 but he was more aware of the girl
 and he would not have known one if he encountered it
 and on earth he put man
 he gave man a free will
 nor is he as tough or as smart as he thinks he is
 he can blow himself to kingdom come
 he was -- without being aware of it -- introducing a new era: the invincible navy
 and thus he came upon emil hillerman
 he whirled and sought to identify pardeau in the semi-darkness
 it was as though he surveyed hillerman from behind the bulwark of some new and hostile information
 even as he stared
" "i -- i -- " but hillerman seemed to lose the courage he'd screwed up to continue in this direction
 then he turned and strode swiftly from the foyer
 he was saying: " -- and so under the banner of complete solidarity

 we took him into custody shortly after he perfected the formula and were fortunate in persuading him to give it to us

 immediately he snapped on the loudspeaker
 why couldn't he have gone to mercury
 but he would make no mistakes because he had the stranger's skull under his arm
 he studied the dim outline of the building rising up before them
 he drew a sliding wall away
 he stared down at the bones
he two 
 apparently they were convinced that he meant it
 he has been dead just two centuries
 he sniffed the air
 he stood before the mirror over the shelf
 ' the first things he noticed
 he went over to a table and sat down by a heap of magazines
 he crossed the room to a wide rack against the wall
 he took a roll of them over to the table and began to scan them quickly
 at last hp found what he wanted
 he carried the gazette back to the racks and then
 he sat down by the road and began to go through them
 -- he walked back through the main section of town
 he turned a second corner and went up a side street
 he would know as soon as the founder appeared
 why does he wear a beard
 didn't he have a beard
 make sure i don't miss him if he comes
 usually only the church has been interested enough -- " he broke off
 he's so -- so prosaic
 he stared at them
 just because he doesn't drive a packard and go to cooper high
 probably he was part of some civil control organization
 he whispered to himself
 he was almost to the corner when bill came slowly out
 t he day was warm and bright
 he climbed a hill and strode down the other side
 he walked up on the ridge
 he stared at her
 he sat up as he saw the two of them coming toward him
 or maybe he was joe french
 and he -- he saw the skull
 he picked up the skull
 he turned the skull over
 then he went to the mirror
 he held the skull up
 after a time he put the skull down
 he turned toward the skull
 what did it matter if he put it off a month
 but by a strange twist of science he would " appear again
 he would die
 he noticed again what he had realized the first time he met her -- that in any man's language she was a beauty
 so he could not slug her
 he grabbed her hair
 as he gulped air
 he swung himself into the raft
 he also had a wooden leg and he stalked across the surface of the sea with all the sureness he might have had with concrete under him
" he gestured toward the three approaching men
" he moved around the raft and stood close to parker
" he spoke to mercedes
 he say we will both get reech -- " "shut up
 he stared at it
 he -- or she -- seemed to be up in the air
 t he bird passed over the village
 he hobbled straight to parker
 he still seemed not to hear retch
 "he was just a messenger
 as he glanced at rozeno
 he reeled away from parker's blow
 he threw parker away from him
" he gestured toward retch
st its sadness when he looked at parker
 the old priest frowned as if he was contemplating mysteries that lay afar
 his heart sank when he saw that even if this was a pt boat
" bill parker found himself being introduced to the woman he loved
 desperately he tried to explain the situation to rozeno
 slowly parker began to realize that this old man was so gentle and so kind himself that he could not comprehend even the thought of anyone else being -- evil
 he recoiled as if he had been stung
 he could distinguish the heavy thud of the tommy-gun
" he glanced from the slot
 he met them at the bottom of the ledge
 he fell backward from the ledge
 gotch explained what he would do to that black priest
 he glanced down at peg-leg
 parker took his eyes off the screen where he had been watching something that he did not pretend to understand
 he watched her slip the eagle into a slot
" a second later he caught himself
" from the wall he took a spear
 silently he passed it to effra
 he was moving with rozeno and ulnar through another opening
 he would also destroy this jezbro puma
 again the two yellow eyes glared at parker as retch brought up the weapon that he held
 he was glad he was not out in one of those corridors
 i depend on the editor of my favorite magazines to choose good stories and if he starts failing i'll quit buying

 baker settled down to the sort of verbal sparring match that he enjoyed
 but now he abruptly switched to english
" he placed the print on the desk
 and was about to pass over when he spotted a hole in the overcast
" n t he next two hours passed swiftly
" m t he leader of the priests indicated by a gesture that he wished us to move along a narrow trail cut in the vines along the rim
 with an effort we could almost ignore scale and perspective and imagine that he was a normal human fifty feet distant
 he appeared a typical young japanese
 after about ten minutes of this he walked over to the leanto structure
 by the fourth week he was drinking # quarts of milk a day and weighed # pounds
 he then took them to the nursery
 he was allowed to view little kazu
 he was struck by an idea which was to grow like kazu himself
 he was in fine health
 "and so we arranged to transport kazu takahashi from japan to a safe location where he might grow to manhood
 but even after the first year he was not more than ten times the normal height
 he was now # feet tall
 he knows the classics of china
 he has studied russian
 he may not always be the tool of the kremlin
 at first he will be but a symbol
" he explained
 but i think he was talking about us
 i think he became excited or angry at the last
he gestured to us to come in
 with an evident effort he calmed himself and called again
 "he has told us your story in detail
 he leaned over so far backward in his effort to be fair that i feared that he was overdoing it
 he remarked that some point in geography could be better explained by a drawing
 and he carried a heavy automatic which was carefully aimed right at us
 he would crush this room like an egg
 and then he turned to the guards and gave a series of rapid orders
 but he was bent over the glass plate of the projector
 and then i realized that the whole place was dark and that he was concentrating on baker's silly map
 he brought the dish and other utensils up to our level and dumped a ton or so of steaming rice at our feet
 and he glanced down at the ground
 the result was that kazu sank into the ground at each step until he reached bedrock
 he turned northwest to the hills to spend the night
 as the planes wheeled for another pass he called out in english that he was a friend
 he resumed a steady dogtrot to the north
 yesterday he visited lhasa
 he made it to lhasa by following the himalayas
" he stepped outside and brought in some cold cooked rice and meat
 he tell me russia sending army to capture me
 and then he abruptly sat down and was violently sick
" he paused and looked up at kazu
 baker explained that he was giving them formal blessings
 he could not accept food from the enemies of china
 he relayed to us some news which he had heard on the radio
 he walked slowly until he was directly beneath the first bomb
 then he turned to the north
 and lifted our box so that he could look at us
 now at last he spoke
 and at first we feared that he would collapse
 nor whether he was internally hurt by the blast
 at first he simply walked westward without any directions from us
 he hurriedly called to kazu to turn northwest before he entered the great tarim basin
 but after a while he stopped at the edge of a lake
 he must reach the kremlin ahead of the warning
 he carefully took off the whole roof
 we saw that he even looked like the first stalin
 becabse he was merciless and efficient and because he hated the free west with a hatred that was deadly and implacable
 he knew he was to die
" he asked us
 t he flight to london and the atlantic crossing seemed unreal
 he was a sick god
 he found that the ocean to the north and west
 but to four men he was known not as a god but as a great and good man
 over their heads hung the control ship and he saw men looking down to see that work was done properly
 in form and visage he was just like all the rest
 he stepped into the street and a huge control truck grounrd to a stop inches before him

 the answer is quality right down the line -- a perfectly logical result
 there is also another point of importance here to the true sciencefiction fan
 the mechanism all three types of life employ to change chemical energy into visible light is marvellously efficient
 one of the major objectives of the study of phosphorescence in fireflies was the acquisition of knowledge of the mechanism in order to improve upon the efficiency of fluorescent lamps and glow tubes

 the berkeley laboratory is dedicated to the study of insect diseases
 agronomists and scientists from all over the world have sent dead insects to berkeley to determine what killed them

 the height of architectural style was the imitation of gothic horrors
 the use of materials such as glass and new synthetic media along with stainless metals and the combining of such structures into a natural relationship with their surroundings lead us to suspect that here is a glowing future in store for architecture
 we can't extrapolate architectural designs to the year # but we can certainly visualize the trend they are taking and from that deduce that certain principles will be applied by future architects
 the skyscraper (which is now slowly dying as an architectural style) may have a new lease on life through the development of the helicopter and the wider use  of flying and moving in three dimensions which will be a surety of the time
 the year # will see plenty of that
 so here's a peek at some author-letters the postman brought us: take the note we received from ted sturgeon who wrote "never underestimate
 ted writes: "the basic idea for this storv was an extension of known ideas -- extrapolation -- the choice of a solidly based scientific or social phenomena and a series of human narratives about their development

 but i'm located some fifty miles south in a continued on page # the hunters wanted animals that lived on far ganymede -- though not as badly as the animals wanted the hunters
 steve head of the venusian swamptiger thought wryly
 and there were a lot mounted on the wall behind him
 ever been off the earth
" "ever been off the north american continent
 giving terse directives to the crew of the gordaky lounging importantly at the foot of the gangplank
" and ffien steve was walking up the gangplank and into the cool metal interior of the gordak
 hair the color of flame and a florid face to match it
 came stalking down the companionway
 sort of a liaison man between the crew and the expedition
 down on the third level looking over the cargo holds
 the third was the lowest level of the gordak:
 or that part of the ship nearest the tubes with the exception of the fission-room itself
 here on the third level were the cages which
 and now on the third level a battery of experts was busy checking the bubble-cages for defects
 with her close-cropped blond hair peeking out around the edges of a black cap
 this is the twenty-second century
 the enlightened century
 it's only logical that some of the remaining forty percent of females have some tough jobs
 deciding to change the subject and feeling utterly ridiculous about the whole conversation
 steve regarded her as a member of the weaker sex
 so i guess the rivalry between them and us didn't help
" the woman removed the black cap from her head
 desolate topography of the jovian moon
 not as tall as steve or the woman
" growled the stocky
 that was the idea
 and drove it against the frenchman's chin
 the idea
 saw a couple of teeth clatter off the wall as the frenchman's mouth flew open
 sagging first at the knees
 steve turned to the woman
 newton's second law of motion carried the ship forward through the near-vacuum of space now
 and there's enough radiation to kill an army unless the shields are up
 charlie was the best
 charlie was a good-looker and attractive to the girls
 i'jn only talking off the top of my head
 and then a whistle shrilled through the length of the ship
 steve looked down and saw the station-men wheeling the small but tremendously lavy plutonium bunkers under the ship
 they blasted clear of the space-station on an orbit that would intersect the mercurian ellipse at perihelion
 the gordak would visit venus
 the planetoid ceres
 the four large jovian moons
 the frenchman was stretched out on the cushions three feet from him
 were as picturesque as the names of the old wild west towns
 the temperature was hot enough to melt tin and lead
 the atmosphere within the dome was a lot like new orleans on a sultry summer day
" and then steve felt them slipping the thick
 he'd stepped through an airlock at the side of the fumacetown dome and plodded out on the surface of mercury
 the rusty desert and the ruins of an eon-old civilization
 the sun swelled to almost four times its size as seen from earth
 a jagged ridge of blood-red mountains bit at the black sky like festering
 looking up at the sun through the smoked goggles of her helmet
 it poked its head up out of the crevice first
 four feet long and a foot across at tlte middle it looked like the product of nightmare
 glassy eye -- with a purple-lipped mouth where the pupil should have been i the mouth opened and shut like that of a fish
 but when steve lifted the monster by its middle and brought it out into the sun
 the lips puckered completely shut and the white slug began to thrash dangerously
 how's the air
 buf by then steve was unconscious from the pain
 the heat did the rest
 ated the air from one of the bubble-cages and increased the temperature to seven hundred degrees fahrenheit
 teejay sat there with half a dozen of the venusian experts
 the woman stood up at once and crossed the floor to steve
 "and how's the extra-zoo expert's bum leg
" teejay turned to the six men seated around the lounge
 clair is -- " then something buzzed shrilly on the adjacent wall
 and cut the connection
 shake a leg down to the fission-room and tell 'em to start straining
 get me kevin mcgann on the intercom
 and tell your orbit-man to figure a way to get us off this trajectory and on a quick ellipse from here to the jovian moons
 and kevin's voice bleated over the intercom : "crew and expedition -- all to general lounge on the double
 just sit still till the rest of 'em get here
 "like the elephant of two centuries ago
 nothing but the immediate problem -- to reach the jovian moons before barling -- nothing else matters
 the red square
 if the barling ship has landed ahead of us
 here's the square
 we'll be a bunch of beaters to drive the anthrovacs together at the center of the square
 but hurt them -- just hurt otle of them so the rest of them can see -- and they'll swarm all over you until either all the men or all the anthrovacs are dead
" "take yourself a group of three idle technicians and check all the vac-suits
 and steve smoked one cigarette after another while the six-man parties disembarked to take up their beater-stations on the edges of the square
 or bigger than the planet mercury and almost as large as pluto
 and their eyes sort of big and too bright behind the face-plates
 it's some sort of a psychological or maybe para-psychological phenomenon and none of the medicos could ever figure it out
 by the time they start beating the anthrovacs in toward the g or dak you'll be feeling better -- and raring to go  to work with that oxygenjag stunt of yours
 imagine how that would settle the over-population problems on earth if people
 steve almost jumped off the floor when a metallic voice blared forth from the loudspeaker
" teejay said into the mike
 the frank buck
 will the fact that we're here first matter
 twice its length separated it from the rubble-strewn pumice when the pilot kicked his jets over again
 and something seemed to slap the frank buck back up toward the starry sky
 the result was a first-rate landing
 because the anthrovac is frightened off easily and unless a hunt is carried on with the utmost precision and timing
 the frank bwca: landed first
 it bounced off barling's jaw with savage force and the man stumbled back against the wall and crashed to the floor
 none of your men is to leave the frank buck
 and we're confined to the g or dak
 we get the first twenty four hours
" steve tossed the coin
" palming the coin
 first man to reach the planet mars
 the men of the frank buck departed
 look at the coin
 silent length of the frank buck
 kevin lumbered back toward the gordak
 around the innercircumference of the ringwall steve ran
 i'm not giving up -- the two figures soared on spurting jets a hundred feet above the surface of ganymede
 make out the two spaceships
 the boy was with us
 and the ringwall might have been the record
 coming toward him over the floor of the ringwall was a huge anthrovac
 i saved stedman's life once already -- and stayed out on the hot side of mercury longer than a person should
 half a thousand feet above the surface of ganymede she circled
" the anthrovac paused a dozen yards from steve
 from crown of head to small
 the nine feet of height
 steve carried the thought to its logical conclusion
" steve looked at the guge
 and steve saw leclarc's face through the glassite helmet
 will the three of you please turn around and march over to the frank buckr they were too stunned to do anything else
 within the frank buck
" they'd been ushered into the main lounge of the frank buck a ship of about the gor dak's dimensions
 the jaw looked painfully swollen too
 but the frenchman waved him off with the neutron gun
 kevin got the idea at once
 the neutron gun hissed violently
 by the second of the three anthrovac hunters
 steve rolled out from under the second hunter
 but the first one met him halfway and pole-axed him down to the floor again with a hard right hand
 which still set the odds at four to three against the trio from the gordak
 but she was the new twentysecond century woman
 the third hunter kicked and thrashed helplessly on the floor as she held him in a head-scissors and a the same time fended off barling-who was crawling around them and looking for an opening
 and promptly polished off the other hunter with a blow that lifted him completely off the floor
 the hunter sat there
 it was kevin who lifted the hunter and hurled him away
 and when steve rolled barling over and pushed him against the wall
 the back of it resting against her brow
 silently they made their way out of the lounge and through the corridors of the frank buck heading for the airlock
 the frank buck blasted off from the surface of ganymede
 but the frank buck took off
 none of my men was at the controls "that doesn't make sense
 we've been out longer than the gordak we have a couple of dozen prize specimens
 and they've taken over the frank buck from stem to stern -- all except those animals that need a special sort of atmosphere to breathe
" teejay opened the door
 ready to bolt after her at the first indications of trouble
 i'd say the three things will fit together when we begin to learn what's going on
 has anyone seen leclarc since the fight
 grassy plain which stretched halfway to the horizon and then began to undulate into low hills
 merely motioning with the weapons
 of the other animals steve saw nothing
 but within the corridors of the frank buck he'd encountered a sand crawler and a desert cat
