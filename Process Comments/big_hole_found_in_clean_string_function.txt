Big hole: The clean_string function isn't splitting words based on newline!!
If a line ends with "and" and the next line starts with "has", clean_string extracts "andhas" which is wrong!
This would surely get compounded across a huge corpus? - except that (would-be luckily) newlines were already omitted
from the corpus dataset I'm using.

Aaand, I solved it!

Issue was in this line:

# Original line:
# text = re.sub(r'\n', '', text)   # Apparently, it's splitting based on newlines but then joining 'em up

# Solution:
text = re.sub(r'\n', ' ', text)   # Solved now
