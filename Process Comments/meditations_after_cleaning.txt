- After data has been cleaned and organized, now the question is, how to measure scientific realism across
  the corpus in a general way.
      - I can find the frequency of the occurrence of words like "interstellar ramjet" etc. but the mere
        frequency does not tell me anything. What do I compare it against?
      - Brainstorming: Can I just find how many books out of the total (don't I still need to separate books then?)
                       contain references to ANY of the concepts/terms I'm looking for?
                           - And then a thought may be, how many references? Just to see whether it's substantially there
                             Just any number of references can be recorded and represented, lol.
                       Most common concepts ...
                       How do I measure the sparseness of realistic concepts' mentions, in a definitive way?
                           - The very fact that the author mentions an "interstellar ramjet" means at least they're hearing
                             about it somewhere?
                       How might I distinguish a hard science fiction book from a space opera book?
                           - See books where some specific concepts are used heavily
                           - Then maybe web scrape its title and find its genre?
                             How to find genre from text?
                       Even a book that mentions a lot of normal physics would also qualify as hard SF right. Example, Expanse.
                       So, how do I distinguish those books?

                       Wow. So cool; I discovered *topic extraction* and LDA!

- Question: Is there a corpus of "realism reviews" with an agglomeration of reviews about specific books' scientific
            realism out there? If so, I can look up each of my books using a chunk of its text with a find function
            and pull up its review with its accuracy score/rating, right?

      - Very interesting indeed. However, I would not proceed to make a giant complex project out of this particular
        subject matter, because science fiction is not so central to humankind's main issues. No need to make a
        comprehensive review project for some "obscure" realm/subject. Do something relevant.

IDEA!: The Copyright Â© symbol OR "Copyright by" is oft used exactly once, near the beginning of the book (conducted several
manual searches through pdfs of published books in various genres also).
       - The number of "Copyright by" instances is very much going to be related to the number of books in the corpus, therefore.
         In fact, if used rightly, it can very much provide me a way to separate the corpus into its constituent books.
             - This is assuming that SF short stories which were included in the corpus, are also included as "books"?
               May not be.
             - Try generating a catalogue of "copyright pages" of all the corpus books? By extracting surrounding 200
               characters, maybe.

Notes: "Quinn Publishing Company" volumes seem to appear a lot in the corpus; the same pattern of Copyright declaration.
       - Try checking how many times "Quinn Publishing Company" appears overall. Then see if there's an avg length per
         volume, and an avg character length per volume.
         - Then, tally the number of characters for all volumes combined, with the number of characters in the corpus.
           See if it's actually Quinn which owns all the texts?
           - If so, we are lucky because then I can also reliably separate the texts into its constituent volumes.

       - Well no, Quinn doesn't own all the texts (makes sense actually; we have THOUSANDS of volumes here!) But it's
         fairly likely that different, specific publishing corporations own volumes that appear continuously in specific
         segments of the texts.
         For eg., fairly deep in the corpus we find "Galaxy Publishing" whose copyright declaration begins with
         "Copyright New York" rather than "Copyright #".
         We can still work very well with this ...
