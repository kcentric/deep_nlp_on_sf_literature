# Version 1 of RegexpTokenizer was:
    tokenizer = RegexpTokenizer(r"[^.?!]+")   # It did not include commas!

# Version 2 was:
    tokenizer = RegexpTokenizer(r"[^.?!,]+")  # It worked very well UNTIL I was testing my find_distances_between_instances
                                              # function:
                                              # The distance between the second and third instance of "hinduism" in the
                                              # current text is 57 words (I visually counted), but it came out as 58
                                              # because the RegexpTokenizer was not using ";" !!

# So, final Version 3:
    tokenizer = RegexpTokenizer(r"[^.?!,;]+")  # Includes the semicolon also
